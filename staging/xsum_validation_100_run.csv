Voges was forced to retire hurt on 86 after suffering the injury while batting during the County Championship draw with Somerset on 4 June.
Middlesex hope to have the Australian back for their T20 Blast game against Hampshire at Lord's on 3 August.
The 37-year-old has scored 230 runs in four first-class games this season at an average of 57.50.
""Losing Adam is naturally a blow as he contributes significantly to everything we do,"" director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
""His absence, however, does give opportunities to other players who are desperate to play in the first XI.
""In the past we have coped well without an overseas player and I expect us to do so now.""
Defending county champions Middlesex are sixth in the Division One table, having drawn all four of their matches this season.
Voges retired from international cricket in February with a Test batting average of 61.87 from 31 innings, second only to Australian great Sir Donald Bradman's career average of 99.94 from 52 Tests.","He made his first-class debut for Western Australia in 2001 and has scored more than 15,000 runs in all formats of the game.

Seven photographs taken in the Norfolk countryside by photographer Josh Olins will appear in the June edition.
In her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes.
The shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition.
The duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012.
Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: ""Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is - full of life, with a great sense of humour, thoughtful and intelligent, and in fact, very beautiful.""
He said the images also encapsulated what Vogue had done over the past 100 years - ""to pair the best photographers with the great personalities of the day, in order to reflect broader shifts in culture and society"".
Alexandra Shulman, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, said: ""To be able to publish a photographic shoot with the Duchess of Cambridge has been one of my greatest ambitions for the magazine.""

Other royal portraits to have featured in the fashion magazine include Diana, Princess of Wales - who graced the cover four times - and Princess Anne.

validation-3,2.087,82,39.29,13.6,Google has hired the creator of one of the web's most notorious forums - 4chan.,0,"Summarize in one sentence:
Chris Poole - known as ""moot"" online - created the site in 2003.
It has gone on to be closely associated with offensive and often illegal activity, including instances where the images of child abuse were shared.
It was widely credited as being the first place where leaked images of nude celebrities were posted following 2014's well-publicised security breach affecting Apple's iCloud service. That incident prompted a policy change on the site.
However, 4chan has also been the rallying point for many instances of online activism from the likes of Anonymous, the loosely organized hacktivism group.
Mr Poole shared news of his new position on blogging site Tumblr.
""When meeting with current and former Googlers, I continually find myself drawn to their intelligence, passion, and enthusiasm - as well as a universal desire to share it with others.""
""I'm also impressed by Google's commitment to enabling these same talented people to tackle some of the world's most interesting and important problems.
He added: ""I can't wait to contribute my own experience from a dozen years of building online communities, and to begin the next chapter of my career at such an incredible company.""
Mr Poole stepped down as the administrator of 4chan in January 2015. Now he is expected to turn his attentions to Google's social networking efforts.
His arrival was welcomed by Bradley Horowitz, the head of ""streams, photos and sharing"" at the search giant's floundering social network, Google+.
""I'm thrilled he's joining our team here at Google,"" Mr Horowitz said.
""Welcome Chris!ï»¿""
Several commentators described the appointment as ""unexpected"" but noted that Mr Poole's expertise with social media could prove useful to the search firm.
