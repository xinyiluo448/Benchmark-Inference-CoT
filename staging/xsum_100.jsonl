It meant the body was taking up more energy from the gut, but the chemicals were preventing fatty tissue from building up and increased the amount of energy being burned.\nOne of the researchers, Prof Jeffrey Gordon, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: \"We don't dine alone, we dine with trillions of friends - we have to consider the microbes which live in our gut.\"\nHowever, the diet was also important for creating the right conditions for the lean twin's bacteria to flourish. A bacterial obesity therapy seems unlikely to work alongside a a diet of greasy burgers.\nThink you're all human? You may need to think again.\nFor every cell that makes up the human body there are 10 bacteria living on and in it.\nThis diversity of life is called the microbiome and it is no surprise that it affects our health.\nThere have even been some patients who have had faecal transplants in an attempt to change the nature of their gut bacteria.\nPatients with C. difficile infections have an imbalance of bacteria which antibiotics sometimes fail to treat.\nSome medical reports suggest that samples taken from a healthy gut and piped into the patient can cure the infection.\nHow big an impact adjusting the microbiome could have on our lives is still debated, but it is an exciting field of research.\nDo faecal transplants have a medical role?\nFirst census of bugs living on us\nKeeping both sets of mice in the same cage kept them both lean if they were fed a low-fat, high-fibre diet. Mice are coprophagic, meaning they eat each other's droppings, and the lean twin's bacteria were passed into the mice which started with bacteria that should have made them obese.\nHowever, a high-fat, low-fibre diet meant the mice still piled on the pounds.\nA human obesity treatment is unlikely to use transplants of thousands of species of bacteria from lean people's guts as it carries the risk of also transferring infectious diseases.\nInstead a search for the exact mix of bacteria which benefit weight - and the right foods to promote their growth - is more likely.\nProf Gordon said the next steps in the field would be \"trying to figure out how general these effects are, what diet ingredients may promote their beneficial activities and to look forward to a time when food and the value of food is considered in light of the microbes that live in our gut - that foods will have to be designed from the inside out as well as from the outside in.\"\nCommenting on the research, Prof Julian Parkhill, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said he expected a future when manipulating bacteria was a part of obesity treatment.\n\"There's a lot of work to do, but this is proof of concept that bacteria in the gut can modulate obesity in adults, but it is diet-dependent,\" he said.\nHe added that changing bacteria was a promising field for other diseases.\nHe told the BBC: \"It's an exciting new area, but I think we need to be careful in promoting it as a cure-all.\n\"It's clear in specific areas - inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, Crohn's - the microbiome is going to be important.\"", "reference": "Bacteria living in our guts seem to be affecting our waistlines and harnessing them could lead to new ways of shedding the pounds, US research suggests."}

Despite the length of Mr Dar's ordeal, he argues it created \"a window to move out of the area safely\".\nThe incident was filmed and shared on social media, causing uproar in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley.\nThe use of Mr Dar as a human shield was criticised around the world. Amnesty International described it as \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amounting to torture\".\nThe Indian government announced there would be an inquiry into the incident but on 22 May, before the inquiry had been completed, the army awarded Major Gogoi a commendation medal for, it said, his \"sustained efforts during counter-insurgency operations\".\nThis incident shows just how difficult India is finding it to keep a lid on unrest in Kashmir.\nIndian army sources have told the BBC that morale among soldiers stationed in the valley is very low. Many any soldiers are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with their role in Kashmir, saying they fear they are effectively becoming an army of occupation.\nMeanwhile, opposition to Indian rule in Kashmir appears to be deepening. That is reflected in the fact that Mr Dar was just one of 7% of eligible voters who actually voted in the by-election - the lowest turnout for decades.\n\"We are fighting a legacy of political betrayal, infiltration, rigging in local elections, cynical politics, bad governance, vested interests, religion and regional divides,\" one senior army officer in Kashmir told my colleague, Soutik Biswas, a few weeks ago.\nThe officer acknowledged how difficult it is to operate in an environment where many people want the army to withdraw and said that, despite efforts to reach out to Kashmiris, the army remains unpopular.\nThis weekend the chief of the Indian army, General Bipin Rawat, was clear why he wanted to honour Major Gogoi.  He told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that the medal was given as a way of boosting the morale of young officers.\nGen Rawat served for many years in Kashmir and, like many Indians, believes much of the opposition to Indian rule is orchestrated by Pakistan.  He described Major Gogoi's actions as an \"innovation\", arguing the armed forces have the right to self-defence and that by using Mr Dar as a human shield, he avoided the need to fire on the crowd.\n\"This is a proxy war and a proxy war is a dirty war. It is played in a dirty way. That is where innovation comes in. You fight a dirty war with innovations,\" he told PTI.\n\"People are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us. If my men ask me what do we do, should I say, just wait and die?  I will come with a nice coffin with a national flag and I will send your bodies home with honour. Is it what I am supposed to tell them as chief?  I have to maintain the morale of my troops who are operating there,\" Gen Rawat said.\nThat's certainly what many Kashmiris fear will happen. They say that the award of the medal to Major Gogoi has deepened opposition to Indian rule and to the presence of the army.\nGen Rawat actually appears to be keen to see an escalation in the conflict in Kashmir. \"In fact,\" he told journalists, \"I wish these people, instead of throwing stones at us, were firing weapons at us. Then I would have been happy. Then I could do what I [want to do].\"\nThis is an extraordinary sentiment and a measure of just how difficult India is finding it to keep order in its most restive province.\nHis worry is that Kashmiris are losing their fear of his troops. If that happens, he says, the country is doomed.\n\"Adversaries must be afraid of you and at the same time your people must be afraid of you,\" says Gen Rawat. \"We are a friendly army, but when we are called to restore law and order, people have to be afraid of us.\"", "reference": "If you want to know why India has courted international controversy by awarding a medal to an army officer who tied a civilian to the front of a jeep, you need to understand what is really happening in Indian-administered Kashmir."}

But they were also shifting north and to higher elevations.\nThe team thinks this is to try to get to cooler ground and also to avoid the mosquitoes that are booming as the region gets warmer and wetter.\n\"They just move and move and move to escape them,\" said Prof Petrov.\nThis is extending the distance that the animals have to migrate between winter and summer.\n\"They now have to travel much longer distances to reach those areas with their newborn calves, and that means there is an increase in calf mortality.\"\nHe added that rivers in the region were also growing in size, making them more dangerous for the animals as they had to swim rather than walk across them.\nIn addition, food in the summer grounds is becoming more scarce, especially as the animals move to higher elevations.\nProf Petrov said it was important to try to halt the decline.\n\"Reindeer are tremendously important for biodiversity - they are part of the Arctic food chain and without them other species would be in trouble,\" he explained.\n\"But on the other hand, in all the areas they inhabit, they are vital for peopleâ€™s survival.\n\"Thousands and thousands of people rely on wild reindeer; it is the basis of their subsistence economy.

{"id": "validation-58", "prompt": "Summarize in one sentence:\nWe are about to enjoy (!) the next act in the absurdist drama \"Waiting for the Fed\" (to raise interest rates again).\nTruth be told, we can be fairly sure how this scene will play out.  Once again no increase in rates.  Perhaps Godot will turn up first.\nThe Fed is holding a policy making meeting and an interest rate rise is in theory at least on the agenda.\nJanet Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues would like to get rates back to more normal levels. The Fed currently aims to keep its main policy rate (the rates banks offer to lend to each other overnight) within a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.\nThey raised it to that level in December last year, from practically zero where it had been since the depth of the financial crisis.\nBut nobody expects they will hike rates at this meeting, largely because of the very weak performance of the jobs market in May.\nThe number in employment rose by only 38,000, the fewest since September 2010. Because the US population is growing, the number of people with jobs has to rise by more than that just to keep pace. Employment growth in April was better, but still not all that strong.\nIt's true that the unemployment rate fell markedly in May, to 4.7% from 5%. But this was due to a decline in the number of people looking for work. They are counted as \"not in the labour force\" rather than unemployed, even if they would like to have a job.\nIn a recent speech, Ms Yellen described the May jobs report as disappointing and concerning. She did, however, manage to find one encouraging thing; a faster increase in average hourly earnings. After a long period in which the economic recovery has failed to have much of a favourable impact on pay it was, she said, \"a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up\".\nInflation is another factor that encourages the Fed to feel it has no need to rush the next rate rise.  The latest figure for the inflation measure the Fed prefers was 1.1% in April, compared with its 2% target.\nThat it is so low reflects some transitory factors, including the strength of the dollar (which makes imported goods cheaper) and the decline in energy prices over the last two years. But in time, those factors cease to have a direct impact, so Ms Yellen expects inflation to move back towards 2%.\nShe also said that it's important not to attach too much significance to a single monthly jobs report. In short, a good report next month could bring interest rate rises a lot closer.\nSo while investors think the date of the next rate increase has gone further into the future as a result of the May jobs data, the Fed is always ready to change its plans if new figures change the picture.\nLooking at the US economy from a longer term perspective, it is a remarkable state of affairs that we should have rates still so close to record lows in a recovery that has been underway for several years.\nThe US economy started to grow again in the second half of 2009. Since then it has expanded in 25 out of 27 quarters. The production of goods and services, GDP, is 10% higher than the pre-recession peak, and it's 15% up from the low it reached during the downturn.\nThere has, however, been a slowdown in the growth of productivity in the US, which pre-dates the recession.\nThe labour market has also gained strength despite May's disappointment. The unemployment rate is now 4.7%, compared to 10% in October 2009. The number of people with jobs has increased by 14 million from its low point in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\nBut the US has not managed to get back to pre-crisis levels for the percentage of the working age population with jobs.  The latest figure is just below 59%. In 2006 it was more than 63%.\nSome of the decline is due to long term factors. The US population is ageing; many of the baby boomer generation are retiring.  More young people are taking post-secondary education.\nThe recession and its lingering after effects also had an impact. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US publishes figures on the number of people who want to work but haven't looked in the last four weeks, and for people working part-time who would like longer hours.\nThis group, plus those who are officially classified as unemployed, add up to what is sometimes called \"slack in the labour market\"; people who want to work but aren't.\nThe numbers have declined markedly over the last few years, although one of the concerning things about the May report was a reversal on one aspect; there were more people wanting longer hours.\nNonetheless Ms Yellen said in her recent speech: \"I believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labour market since the recession\".\nThe US economy has come a long way from the panic of late 2008. The Fed's interest rate policy has started the journey back to normality. But it will be very slow. And the US can't be considered immune to turbulence that might hit the global economy.", "reference": "Perhaps the playwright Samuel Beckett was a secret economist."}

According to Tom Worville, a data scientist at football analysts Opta, the answer is a resounding yes.\nUsing an historical database built using information such as the build-up, distance, angle and placement of more than 250,000 shots, Opta can evaluate 'Expected Goals' - the quality of any chance a player has, and how likely it is to be saved.\nOr, in Bravo's case, whether it should have been...\nBased on the historic quality of those 57 shots on target against City, only 16 should have beaten Bravo, not 23.\nThe £15.4m summer signing from Barcelona has conceded 6.7 goals more than he should have done, putting him in the bottom five of the 23 Premier League keepers to have faced more than 100 shots in 2016-17.\nIt gets worse for Bravo when Opta focus on his current eight-game run that has seen him concede 14 goals from 22 shots on target.\n\"Of those 22 shots, we get an 'Expected Goals' figure of 7.33 - so he has conceded nearly double than expected in that time,\" added Worville. \"It's a huge deficit, and the figures are pretty damning.\n\"I'm hesitant to jump to the conclusion that Bravo is a poor goalkeeper - we know that he isn't - but he's having a terrible time at the moment.\"\nMost keepers are having a better time right now, including all of Bravo's counterparts at other top-six clubs.\nIt is a 12-goal swing from Bravo's figures to those of Burnley's Tom Heaton, the Premier League's top performer by Opta's calculations.\nHeaton has saved almost five 'expected' goals this season - enough to give him the edge over the likes of Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Arsenal's Petr Cech, who average around three apiece.\nDavid de Gea has 'saved' one goal for Manchester United while Liverpool's Simon Mignolet has conceded one more than expected. All of them are doing much better than Bravo, though.\nFew City fans thought that allowing Joe Hart to leave for a season in Serie A was a good idea back in August. It is possible only Pep Guardiola thinks that is the case now.\nOver in Italy, Hart has had a positive effect to the Torino backline, despite conceding the same amount of goals and playing the same number of minutes as Bravo at City.\nBravo has delivered in one area for City, however, and it is the main reason they signed him in the first place.\nHis passing accuracy in his 18 Premier League games so far is 71.5%, ranked second only to Lloris. That might provide some solace to Guardiola, although even he would probably prefer it if his keeper started making some saves.\n\"Considering Joe Hart has conceded about one goal fewer than expected, it's easy to jump to the conclusion that with him between the sticks, City may have conceded fewer this season,\" Worville explained.\n\"Hart's playing behind a different defence though, which definitely has an impact on the quality of shots that he's facing.\n\"Additionally there's a lot more to goalkeeping than making stops, with the distribution side of things being one of the main reasons Bravo was bought back in the summer.\n\"Having Hart in the team may have lead to fewer goals conceded, but at the same time it may have impacted the style of play Pep wanted to implement.\"", "reference": "For many, Claudio Bravo's first five months in English football were neatly summed up by the caller to the BBC's 606 phone-in last weekend who dubbed the Manchester City goalkeeper a 'false no. 1'."}

Time to turn the policy taps off?\nNot necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices.

It features gradients of 20%, while stage 15 finishes at an altitude of 2,510m in Sierra Nevada. The penultimate stage pits the riders against the infamous Alto de Angliru, where Sky lost the 2011 Vuelta when Froome waited for team leader Bradley Wiggins as Juan Jose Cobo launched a race-winning attack.\nAn opening team time trial in Nimes should not be long enough to create any significant time gaps between those chasing the overall victory but crucial seconds will be won and lost.\nRace organisers will hope the 40km individual time trial on stage 16 will help balance out the climbs but it could just serve to strengthen Froome's grip on the title.\nSprinter-friendly stages are few, although those that make it to the finale are rewarded with a chance of glory in Madrid.\nIn a nutshell, he can climb with the best in the race and is a better time-trial rider. He has finished runner-up on three occasions and goes into the race saying he has \"unfinished business\".\nThe 32-year-old also has arguably the strongest nine-man squad to help keep him out of trouble on flatter stages and set the pace on the tougher ascents. And, given his excellent form in the third and final week of July's Tour de France, Froome appears to have tailored his season to perfection, allowing him to also peak for the Vuelta.\nOn the eve of the race, he said: \"The plan was to have a lighter first part of the season and I think that's worked. I certainly feel fresher. But whether that's reflected in the racing we'll have to wait and see.\"\nFroome's rivals know they need to attack on ascents and descents in the mountains in the hope of picking up enough seconds to neutralise the time they will expect to lose in the 40km individual time trial.\nAnd that stage 16 is one that Froome has earmarked. \"The time trial is one day I'm looking forward to, a lot of time can be won or lost there,\" he said. \"And of course stage 20 to the Angliru is a massive stage.\"\nRomain Bardet - the AG2R La Mondiale rider was the big hope for a first French Tour winner since 1985 in July, but he knows he needs to up his time trialling skills if he is to finally win a Grand Tour.\nHe lost almost two minutes to Froome over a 22km course in Marseille in July. Bardet, who is riding in his first Vuelta, said: \"My ambitions will be different than in the Tour de France but surrounded by a strong team, I hope to make an impact on stages that suit me.\"\nFabio Aru - the Italian won this race in 2015 and will love the steep climbs. However, he too lost significant time to Froome in the Tour's time trial and is wary of the Vuelta's team test on day one. He said: \"I think I've recovered well after the Tour and have a good team with me.\nWe've got to limit the damage in the opening team time trail and be ready for the wind on Sunday. The nine uphill finishes means we'll be flat out all the time. It'll be good to watch, with time gaps each time.\"\nVincenzo Nibali - the Italian is one of six riders to have won all three Grand Tours and will be relatively fresh having missed the Tour after finishing third in the Giro.\nFroome has picked out the Bahrain-Merida rider as his main threat. However, his team is not as strong as Sky's and he too will need to attack in the mountains because he is an inferior time trialler. He said: \"I'm feeling pretty good. We'll find out how good along the road, day by day. I did a good block of training in the Dolomites that gave me the answers [about my form] that I was looking for.\"\nAlberto Contador - the 34-year-old winner of eight Grand Tours is calling time on his career after the Vuelta but insists it won't be a lap of honour round his home country.\nThe three-time Vuelta winner said: \"I have always given my maximum as a rider and I will do that now. This Vuelta is special, and I want to enjoy it. I feel lucky that I can be here, it's a really good place to say goodbye. So I want to see how the legs are feeling, see what kind of form my rivals have, but I have come with the idea of fighting to win and to enjoy it, too.\"\nAside from Froome, the Yates twins Adam and Simon provide the biggest hope of a podium finish for a British rider. The Orica-Scott pair are racing together in a Grand Tour for the first time since since the 2015 Tour de France and are part of a three-pronged attack for the Australian-based team.\nAdam finished ninth at the Giro d'Italia in May and has a best Grand Tour finish of fourth at last year's Tour de France, when he also became the first Briton to win the young rider classification. Simon won that category in this year's race, finishing seventh overall, his best in a three-week race.\nBoth are competing in a second Grand Tour in the same year for the first time but Adam is buoyant about their chances, particularly because they also have renowned climber Esteban Chaves in their squad.\n\"If we can get on the podium, that'd be great, whether it's me, or Simon or Esteban,\" he told Cycling News.\n\"Esteban is another card we can play, especially in the third week.

{"id": "validation-81", "prompt": "Summarize in one sentence:\nHow much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.\nIt used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.\nThis is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.\nThen we had the financial crisis of 2008.\nThe upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.\nFor example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.\nThe figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.\nDespite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.\nBy their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.\nBy the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.\nA large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.\nAt the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.\nHome ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.\nSimilarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.\nThe lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.\nIn their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.\nAt the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.\nFor today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.\nLower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.\nOf course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.\nThe vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.\nThis is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.\nThe schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.\nIn their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.\nThis compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.\nIn 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.\nWith stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.\nBut those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.\nOf those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.\nOur data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.\nWithin each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.\nAmong the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.\nThis compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.\nData is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.\nSo, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.\nBut most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.\nIt looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAndrew Hood is a senior research economist at the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), specialising in income, work and welfare.\nThe IFS describes itself as an independent research institute which aims to inform public debate on economics.

A minister wouldn't advertise disunity.\nThe surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time.\nInsiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view.\nSome of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing -  or as some say \"no cliff edge\" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues.\nSo much for unity. Where do differences still lie?\nIt was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy.\nBut for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist.\nLiam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years.\nAs one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter.\nBut anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a \"disaster\" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period.\nThen what form will any transition take?\nCould there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent.\nShould we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit?\nThe EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table.\nSo while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved.\nAnd, of course, I use the term 'Remainer\" historically - the cabinet is also united on leaving the EU but the question is how.\nThere has been talk of soft, hard and clean Brexits. Increasingly another word has entered the lexicon.\nDavid Davis uses it. Michael Gove used it today. Expect to hear more of it. Pragmatic. That's now the goal - a pragmatic Brexit. And that necessarily means compromise at cabinet level as well as with the EU.", "reference": "The government and the cabinet \"is united\"."}
