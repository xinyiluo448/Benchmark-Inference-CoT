Taylor, 31, the first Kiwi double centurion against Australia, reached 290 before he was the last man to fall.
His score surpassed that of England's Tip Foster, who scored 287 against Australia in Sydney in 1903.
New Zealand made 624, their first 600 against Australia, but the hosts added 258-2 to lead by 193 with one day left.
Resuming on 235 in Perth, Taylor made the third-highest score by a New Zealand batsman. Brendon McCullum got a triple century against India in Wellington last year.
Taylor batted for nine and a half hours, facing 374 balls and hitting 43 boundaries before he was caught at deep square-leg by substitute fielder Jonny Wells.
That denied him becoming only the second batsman to score a triple century against Australia, after England's Len Hutton, who made 364 at The Oval in 1938.
It was New Zealand's fifth-highest Test team total, the record being set as recently as last year with 690 against Pakistan in Sharjah.
Having begun day four on 510-6 at the Waca, New Zealand were soon reduced to 587-9 before last man Trent Boult helped Taylor guide them past 600 and a first-innings lead of 65.
Australia lost Joe Burns for a duck in the third over but Steve Smith hit his fourth hundred as captain in only his fifth Test in charge. He shared an unbroken partnership of 212 in 55 overs with Adam Voges (101) who became the sixth centurion of the match.
Taylor celebrated both his century and double century on day three by sticking his tongue out in a message to his daughter.
He added he was ""undercooked"" going into the first Test, which New Zealand lost, after he was sidelined for six weeks by an injury to his testicles sustained in the nets in Zimbabwe in August.
""I felt I just needed to get back in the groove,"" Taylor said.
""You can either graft it out or go out and play your shots and the latter probably comes more natural to me.
""It's surprising what happens when you hit a couple off the middle, the feet start moving and the confidence comes flooding back.""
Some observers highlighted the fact that Taylor was not congratulated by the Australian players at the end of his innings.
Australia opening batsman David Warner took to Twitter to explain that as Taylor was the last player to be dismissed, the home batsmen had to leave the field to prepare for their second innings.","Taylor, New Zealand's first Kiwi double centurion against Australia, made 290 before being the last wicket to fall, setting a new high score and helping his team reach 624, their highest against Australia, before the hosts' 258-2 lead with one day left."

The human body is teeming with thousands of species of microbes that affect health.
A study showed that transplanting gut bacteria from obese people into mice led to the animals gaining weight, while bacteria from lean people kept them slim.
The findings were published in Science.
Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, Missouri, took gut bacteria from pairs of twins - one obese, one thin.
The bacteria were then put into mice which had grown up in completely sterile environments and had no gut bacteria of their own.
Mice with the obese twin's bacteria became heavier and put on more fat than mice given bacteria from a lean twin - and it was not down to the amount of food being eaten.
There were differences in the number and types of bacteria species from the lean and obese twin.
Overall it seemed those from a lean twin were better at breaking down fibre into short-chain fatty acids. It meant the body was taking up more energy from the gut, but the chemicals were preventing fatty tissue from building up and increased the amount of energy being burned.
One of the researchers, Prof Jeffrey Gordon, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: ""We don't dine alone, we dine with trillions of friends - we have to consider the microbes which live in our gut.""
However, the diet was also important for creating the right conditions for the lean twin's bacteria to flourish. A bacterial obesity therapy seems unlikely to work alongside a a diet of greasy burgers.
Think you're all human? You may need to think again.
For every cell that makes up the human body there are 10 bacteria living on and in it.
This diversity of life is called the microbiome and it is no surprise that it affects our health.
There have even been some patients who have had faecal transplants in an attempt to change the nature of their gut bacteria.
Patients with C. difficile infections have an imbalance of bacteria which antibiotics sometimes fail to treat.
Some medical reports suggest that samples taken from a healthy gut and piped into the patient can cure the infection.
How big an impact adjusting the microbiome could have on our lives is still debated, but it is an exciting field of research.
Do faecal transplants have a medical role?
First census of bugs living on us
Keeping both sets of mice in the same cage kept them both lean if they were fed a low-fat, high-fibre diet. Mice are coprophagic, meaning they eat each other's droppings, and the lean twin's bacteria were passed into the mice which started with bacteria that should have made them obese.
However, a high-fat, low-fibre diet meant the mice still piled on the pounds.
A human obesity treatment is unlikely to use transplants of thousands of species of bacteria from lean people's guts as it carries the risk of also transferring infectious diseases.
Instead a search for the exact mix of bacteria which benefit weight - and the right foods to promote their growth - is more likely.
Prof Gordon said the next steps in the field would be ""trying to figure out how general these effects are, what diet ingredients may promote their beneficial activities and to look forward to a time when food and the value of food is considered in light of the microbes that live in our gut - that foods will have to be designed from the inside out as well as from the outside in.""
Commenting on the research, Prof Julian Parkhill, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said he expected a future when manipulating bacteria was a part of obesity treatment.
""There's a lot of work to do, but this is proof of concept that bacteria in the gut can modulate obesity in adults, but it is diet-dependent,"" he said.
He added that changing bacteria was a promising field for other diseases.
He told the BBC: ""It's an exciting new area, but I think we need to be careful in promoting it as a cure-all.
""It's clear in specific areas - inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, Crohn's - the microbiome is going to be important.""","A study published in Science found that transplanting gut bacteria from obese individuals into mice caused them to gain weight, while bacteria from lean individuals maintained their slimness, suggesting that the diversity and types of bacteria in the gut play a significant role in health and weight."

Naweed Ali, 29, from Sparkhill, Birmingham, is on trial along with three other men from the West Midlands.
The four deny preparing terrorist acts.
They were arrested on 26 August after a partially-constructed pipe bomb, machete and imitation gun were discovered by security services in Mr Ali's car.
Both Mr Ali, of Evelyn Road, and his co-accused Khobaib Hussain, 25, also of Evelyn Road, have previous convictions for attending a terror training camp.
See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here
The Old Bailey heard Mr Ali had been employed by the officer - described in court only as ""Vincent"" - to deliver parcels.
On his first day, Mr Ali's Seat Leon was parked at a depot in Birmingham city centre while he went to Luton to deliver a parcel, the court heard.
Cross-examining, Stephen Kamlish QC suggested the officer had planted a bag of incriminating evidence in Mr Ali's car before MI5 arrived to bug it.
Mr Kamlish, for Mr Ali, said to Vincent: ""You had until he left the car and MI5 came in, to plant a bag of incriminating items in his car. This was your only opportunity - yes or no?""
The officer said: ""That's a interesting work of fiction. I'm afraid nothing you have just said to me makes any sense to me whatsoever. So no.""
At a previous hearing, Vincent told jurors that during a search of Mr Ali's car, what appeared to be a pipe bomb and a handgun were found inside a JD Sports bag.
He told jurors he and another officer had eased the contents of the bag on to a ground sheet and carried it into a different room.
On Monday, Mr Kamlish asked the officer why he had put his hand in the bag and pulled out what he thought was a ""live bomb"" after the secret services had been told to leave the depot.
Vincent said it was a ""calculated risk"" and added: ""I'm not a bomb disposal expert but I know what a pipe bomb looks like.
""This was a fast-moving, difficult situation and difficult decisions had to be made and that difficult decision was made.""
The barrister told Vincent he had known it was not a real bomb ""because you put it there"".
Asked if he planted the device, Vincent said: ""I would never be involved in anything like that, have never, and will never.""

Prince William held talks with President Obama in the Oval Office, in advance of delivering a speech to the World Bank on wildlife crime.
During the speech, he described the illegal wildlife trade as ""one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today"".
His wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, visited a New York children's centre.
The couple arrived in New York on Sunday night, with the prince travelling to Washington alone on Monday.
At the White House, the prince joked with Mr Obama about the birth of Prince George, saying: ""The excitement of the event and everything else was just chaos.""
He added that he expects a ""busy year"" in 2015, when Catherine is due to give birth to the royal couple's second child.
President Obama said the prince's work to protect endangered wildlife was ""very important"".
It seems fair to assume that America's first family would happily have received William and his wife to the White House.
As it was, only Prince William got to sit by the presidential fireplace in the Oval Office and chat to President Obama, reminiscing about the birth of Prince George and presumably - after the media had been ushered out - discussing his campaign against the illegal trade in wildlife parts.
Catherine had stayed in New York to pursue her very deliberately separate programme.
Both the tour planners and the couple are anxious to give both of them a chance to be seen pursuing their separate objectives without either overshadowing the other.
And so Prince William was given a clear run to pay his visit to the White House and deliver his speech at the World Bank without any risk of being upstaged by Catherine's presence.
There is certainly not the envy or sense of competition that existed between Prince William's father and mother when they were fulfilling engagements.
Instead there is a realistic awareness of each other's ability to command column inches and a desire to work together to achieve the maximum impact.
Later, in his speech at the World Bank, the prince said: ""In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today is the illegal wildlife trade.""
He attacked those who ""loot our planet to feed mankind's ignorant craving for exotic pets, trinkets, cures and ornaments derived from the world's vanishing and irreplaceable species"".
Paying tribute to his father, the Prince of Wales, and his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, he said: ""They helped to bring about a revolution in attitudes towards our natural environment.""
Prince William founded the umbrella organisation United for Wildlife to try to preserve the planet's most endangered animals and habitats.
The prince has been the royal patron of Tusk since 2005. The charity supports projects in 17 African countries, aimed at protecting wildlife and alleviating poverty.
Before starting at St Andrews University, the prince went on a gap year, some of which was spent in Africa learning about its wildlife and game conservation.
He added: ""From them, I learned that our relation to nature and wildlife goes to the heart of our identity as human beings. From our sheer survival, to our appreciation of beauty and our connection to all other living things.
""Seen in this light, the extinction of any of the world's species of animals is a loss to all humanity.""He said wildlife crime ""goes to the heart of our security"", ""distorts economic development"" and ""fuels sources of conflict"".

The duchess, meanwhile, visited Harlem's Northside Centre for Child Development.
She was greeted with cheers from well-wishers when she arrived at the centre, which provides educational and mental health services to children and families.
Some of the youngsters believed Catherine was Princess Elsa from the hit animated movie Frozen.
Rose Ann Harris, director of early childhood services, said: ""When they heard she was coming they thought it was Elsa - we said a princess and they got a princess.""
Later, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her daughter Chelsea at a reception held at the British Consul General's residence to highlight conservation efforts.
They then attended a NBA basketball game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Ahead of the visit, Danny Lopez, the British consul general in New York, said there had been ""incredible interest"" in the royal couple.
He said there was ""huge excitement"" from people in the city.

The recipient, Wolfang Rangger, who lost his right leg in 2007, said: ""It feels like I have a foot again.  It's like a second lease of life.""
Prof Hubert Egger of the University of Linz, said sensors fitted to the sole of the artificial foot, stimulated nerves at the base of the stump.
He added it was the first time that a leg amputee had been fitted with a sensory-enhanced prosthesis.
Surgeons first rewired nerve endings in the patient's stump to place them close to the skin surface.
Six sensors were fitted to the base of the foot, to measure the pressure of heel, toe and foot movement.
These signals were relayed to a micro-controller which relayed them to stimulators inside the shaft where it touched the base of the stump.
These vibrated, stimulating the nerve endings under the skin, which relayed the signals to the brain.
Prof Egger said: ""The sensors tell the brain there is a foot and the wearer has the impression that it rolls off the ground when he walks.""
Wolfgang Ranger, a former teacher, who lost his leg after a blood clot caused by a stroke, has been testing the device for six months, both in the lab and at home.
He said:  ""I no longer slip on ice and I can tell whether I walk on gravel, concrete, grass or sand.  I can even feel small stones.""
The 54-year-old also runs, cycles and goes climbing.
Another major benefit was a reduction in excruciating ""phantom limb"" pain felt by Mr Rangger for years following the amputation.
Prof Egger said the brain now received real data rather than searching for information from the missing limb.
The Austrian research team unveiled their results at a press conference in Vienna.
But they have yet to publish details in a medical journal.
Last year an international team created a bionic hand which allows the amputee to feel sensations from their fingers.
Their study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Dr Alastair Ritchie, lecturer in Biomaterials and Bioengineering, University of Nottingham, said the Austrian announcement was exciting but not as groundbreaking as the work already done for the arm and hand.","A prosthetic foot equipped with sensors that stimulate nerves at the base of an amputee's stump, allowing them to perceive pressure and texture, has been developed and reported to significantly reduce phantom limb pain and improve mobility for Wolfgang Rangger, according to researchers from the University of Linz."

Downing Street and the White House are believed to be looking at options for the visit.
Mr Trump accepted the Queen's invitation for him to travel to Britain on a state visit when UK PM Theresa May visited Washington in January.
But the prospect of a state visit caused much controversy and reportedly led Mr Trump to change his mind.
It was said he did not want to visit while there was potential for protests against him.
Nearly two million people signed one of a number of petitions saying Mr Trump should not be invited to the UK on a state visit.
What is a state visit?
Senior politicians, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron who called Mr Trump ""an embarrassment to America"", said the visit should not go ahead.
Questions were also raised as to why Mr Trump was invited so soon after taking office - it was two-and-a-half years into his first term before his predecessor Barack Obama came to the UK for his state visit.
Mrs May extended the invitation to the president just as he sparked anger across the world with his proposed travel ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries.
The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, clashed with Mr Trump over the immigration measures, later saying the UK should not ""roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for"".
Confirmation of Mr Trump's visit had been expected in last month's Queen's Speech, in which the Queen set out her official plans for the year.
But there was no mention of it, and October was later mooted as a possible date.
The White House denied reports that Mr Trump had reservations about visiting, saying they looked forward to working out a ""mutually acceptable date"".
The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state a year. She has hosted 109 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952.
State visits are grand, ceremonial occasions, but have a political purpose too, with governments using them to further what they see as Britain's national interests.","UK officials are considering alternatives to a planned state visit by US President Donald Trump following reported controversy and his decision not to visit during potential protests, with October suggested as a possible date."

""But instead the court was confronted by the absurd irony of a UKIP MEP claiming EU sovereignty and immunity as an MEP from action in the British courts.""
The three MPs, Sarah Champion, John Healey and Sir Kevin Barron, whose neighbouring constituencies cover Rotherham, had been accused by Jane Collins of ""knowing all about"" the scandal of 1,400 cases of grooming and rape of young girls in the town and doing nothing to intervene.
The allegations were made in a speech Jane Collins made at the UKIP conference held at Doncaster Racecourse in September 2014 and broadcast live on the BBC Parliament Channel.
At the time Ms Collins had been selected as the candidate to stand against Sarah Champion in her Rotherham seat at the upcoming General Election.
At a previous hearing in 2015 the High Court threw out the UKIP legal team's defence that the speech should be treated as routine political comment and ruled her intention had clearly been libellous.
It had taken a year to get Jane Collins back in court for the Judge, Mr Justice Welby, to assess the level of costs and damages.
The judge said he thought it ""improbable"" immunity from paying up would be granted but he suspended proceedings until the European Parliament had had an opportunity to investigate her application.
Legal immunity for MEPs has existed under European law since 1965 but in very limited circumstances.
It is similar to the ""parliamentary privilege"" enjoyed by UK MPs who are free to make any comments they want in speeches made in the House of Commons with no fear of legal action being taken against them.
What UK MPs say outside the chamber has no legal protection at all.
A committee of MEPs in Brussels are now expected to take several months to decide whether the European version of ""parliamentary privilege"" can be stretched to cover a speech made at a party political conference by someone who was bidding to beat one of those she libelled at the next General Election.
An unrepentant Jane Collins issued a defiant statement claiming the libelled Labour MPs had only themselves to blame for the latest turn of events.
She pointed out that the Labour Party supports remaining in the European Union which means keeping all existing EU laws and regulations, including the one which gives her the chance of an escape route from paying damages.
""It seems bizarre that they are so keen for UK law to be supreme when it suits them but not when it suits the country,"" her statement concluded.","UKIP MEP Jane Collins is attempting to avoid paying substantial damages for libel by claiming parliamentary immunity under EU law, despite being a vocal critic of the EU, leading to a legal irony as she appeals for help from the institution she opposes."

A commission of inquiry was set up five years ago to look into the allegations surrounding the 1999 government deal.
Mr Zuma was sacked as deputy president in 2005 after his financial adviser was convicted of corruption over the deal.
The president on Thursday announced the inquiry had found no evidence against any government officials of the time.
He said money had been paid for consultancy services ""and nothing else"".
The allegations relate to the government's purchase of 30bn rand (then $5bn) worth of fighter jets, helicopters, submarines and warships in 1999.
Mr Zuma was sacked as deputy president in 2005 after his then financial adviser Schabir Shaik was found guilty of trying to solicit bribes for his boss from an arms company.
Mr Zuma always denied the allegations, and in 2009 prosecutors dropped 700 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering against him, just weeks before elections which saw him become president.
But his critics refused to let the issue drop, so in 2011 he agreed to appoint a commission to investigate the arms deal, which concluded its enquiries at the end of last year.
This is not the only controversy he has been implicated in. Last month South Africa's highest court ruled he had violated the constitution by failing to repay government money for a luxurious upgrade on his private residence.
The investigation, which took four years to conclude, found no evidence of widespread bribery, corruption and fraud in the selection of the preferred bidder to supply the arms, or of payment of bribes to officials in the awarding of the deal.
The three-volume report on the investigation, which will be made public, has not made any recommendations for further investigations, leading some to believe the ANC is covering up for its leader and other officials who were implicated.
The opposition Democratic Alliance believes the Arms Procurement Commission made no real effort to investigate the allegations contained in crucial documents. It has described the final report as a massive disappointment because no-one will face criminal charges.","South African President Jacob Zuma says an inquiry into the 1999 government arms deal found no evidence of corruption, despite earlier allegations, but critics argue the findings lack substance and the ANC may be protecting officials."

The 66-year-old Brisbane Broncos boss will speak to RFL officials before deciding whether to accept a position.
Steve McNamara's contract as England coach expired after the 2-1 series win over New Zealand last autumn.
Bennett told the Brisbane Courier-Mail: ""We haven't finalised the role but I've been offered some opportunities. I have to find out how they see me involved.""
Bennett is one of the game's most experienced coaches and was in charge of Brisbane for 20 years from their formation in 1988. He won six Grand Finals before moving to St George-Illawarra Dragons, where he won another NRL title in 2010.
In addition, he has had three spells with the Queensland State of Origin team and two spells in charge of the national team.
A passionate supporter of international rugby league, he was part of the New Zealand coaching team that won the World Cup in 2008, but was overlooked in favour of Mal Meninga when he applied for the Australia job again in December 2015.

""Everything is on the table,"" said Bennett. ""I wanted to coach Australia, but it's not available now. I wanted to make a contribution to international rugby league.
""About five years ago, the RFL first arrived at my doorstep. It is always about finding the right timing.""
The RFL has refused to comment on any discussions with Bennett. It is carrying out a review of the England set-up, which will be concluded in February.
Bennett is due in England next month for Brisbane's World Club Series game at Wigan on 20 February.
England will play Australia, New Zealand and Scotland in the Four Nations tournament in November.
BBC Sport's Simon Stone
Wayne Bennett is one of the most respected coaches in rugby league and his appointment - even on a part-time basis - would be a huge coup for the RFL. But if, as anticipated, Bennett combined the job with his present role with Brisbane Broncos, it would raise an issue over how well he knew the Super League players he would be working with.
Many of England's top players, including Canterbury's James Graham and Sam Burgess, who recently returned to the sport after an ill-fated spell in rugby union, are based in Australia. But the majority remain in England and while Bennett will be able to watch virtually every Super League game on TV, he will be relying largely on the opinions of others when it comes to their personalities.","Rugby League Federation (RLF) officials are considering offering a part-time coaching position to experienced Brisbane Broncos boss Wayne Bennett, who is weighing the option after Steve McNamara's England contract ended, potentially raising concerns over his familiarity with Super League players due to their Australian base."

The 16-year-old slotted in Sone Aluko's backheel after the break and then fired home just before the hour mark.
Tom Cairney had put Fulham ahead with a 25-yard strike into the top corner.
After Daryl Murphy curled in a consolation for the hosts, Tim Ream missed a chance to make it 4-1 when he sent a stoppage-time penalty wide.
Sessegnon appeared to want to take the spot-kick to complete his hat-trick after Paul Dummett brought him down, but USA international Ream took the ball and smashed it past the right post.
Fulham have now won five of their last seven league games and are just two points behind sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday with a game in hand.
They thoroughly outclassed an out-of-sorts Newcastle side, with skipper Cairney's second fantastic long-range goal in the space of a few days, after his stoppage-time equaliser against Leeds on Tuesday, setting the tone.
However, it was left-back Sessegnon, reportedly being scouted by several Premier League clubs, who provided two moments of composure to seal three points for his side with his fifth and sixth goals of the campaign.
It was a nightmare afternoon for Rafael Benitez's Magpies, a year to the day since the Spaniard took charge, with their advantage over third-placed Huddersfield now down to six points.
But over the past 10 seasons in the Championship, an average of 86 points has been enough to gain automatic promotion, so three more wins could be enough to earn an immediate return to the Premier League.
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez: ""We knew it could be a difficult game, and we knew we had to do well at the beginning and not make mistakes. But we started making mistakes, and we paid for that.
""Fulham are a good team - they passed the ball well and they have pace. We were giving the ball away, and that was giving them the chance to play in the way that they like to play.
""When you have tried and have made mistakes, you have to analyse why. It is not as though the players were not trying in terms of effort. Sometimes, it is just the wrong decision, and that is something we have to improve.""
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: ""I believe at the end my team deserved the result. It is a great step for us, everything is open, although some teams have more points than what we have right now.
""I believe Newcastle will be a Premier League team. They play a different style of football - they are physical and a very strong team.
""We are not in a position to think about being a promoted team, but we are going to push hard for the top six. If you have enough strength for this then we have a 25% chance to be a Premier League team next season.""

Claire Darbyshire, 36, killed 67-year-old Brian at their home in Wykeham Green, Dagenham, east London, on 2 September last year.
Afterwards, she claimed they had made a suicide pact as his illness had become ""intolerable"".
But following an Old Bailey trial, a jury found Darbyshire guilty of murder.
Sentencing her, Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC said he accepted that she believed it was an act of mercy.
He said the key to the case was that she failed to establish her father had agreed she would also kill herself in a suicide pact.
He said: ""I accept your evidence that your father did raise the question of ending his own life and he wanted to do that and wanted your help to do so.""
But he told her she had unlawfully killed her father behind ""closed doors"" and no defence to murder applied.
Darbyshire, who was born male but has lived her life as a female, has already spent five months on remand in a men's prison awaiting trial.
Widower Mr Darbyshire developed MS in 1995 and in 2014 the defendant took over as his sole carer.
Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC told jurors that Mr Darbyshire, a retired Ford stock controller, had not expressed any suicidal thoughts or complained about being in pain to nurses who visited him.
Medical records revealed he had episodes of ""bad temper and aggression"", but had never tried to kill himself.
Darbyshire complained to a friend about having to look after him and appeared to be stressed.
After the killing she caught a train to the Dover area, having texted the district nurse to visit ""asap"".
On 3 September, Darbyshire approached a National Trust worker on cliffs for help and ended up with support services in Canterbury.
Five days later she mentioned the suicide pact for the first time. She said they had both taken an overdose on 1 September, which failed to work, before she suffocated her father.
On the morning of 10 September - eight days after the killing - police discovered Mr Darbyshire's body in his bed with a suit, teddy bear and various handwritten notes nearby.
Following her arrest, Darbyshire told police she had planned to hand herself in the next day and a signed account was found among her belongings.
In mitigation, Paul Keleher QC told the court that by 2015, Darbyshire and her father were ""living a life which most people would regard as intolerable"".
He also discussed a report about her time in custody, saying she had thought about self-harm when she first arrived in prison but ""the kindness of strangers... brought her to the realisation that life was not desperate"".
He added: ""The prison will continue to support in terms of her ongoing transformation.""
Det Insp Sarah McConnell from the Met Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command said:  ""The reclusive lifestyle that Brian and Claire Darbyshire had lived for a number of years means it is difficult to fully understand their precise situation.""
She said the unanimous verdict of murder ""has been welcomed by the remaining family of Brian Darbyshire"".","Claire Darbyshire, who claimed to have made a suicide pact with her terminally-ill father, has been found guilty of murder and sentenced for killing him at their home in London, despite failing to establish his agreement, as the court ruled no defense to murder applied."

On 9 April, a Kashmiri man called Farooq Ahmed Dar was trussed to the spare tyre at the front of a jeep and driven on a five-hour journey through several villages at the head of an army convoy.
He had just voted in a by-election for the national parliament when he was picked up by an army patrol.
He was allegedly beaten before he was lashed to the vehicle with a sign saying ""This is the fate that will befall stone throwers"" pinned to his chest.
Kashmir is disputed between India and Pakistan and Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a fresh upsurge of violence in the past few months, with stone-throwing civilians pitted against military personnel.
The young army officer responsible, Major Leetul Gogoi, said Mr Dar was seized because he was directing a stone-throwing mob that was besieging a polling station - something denied by both Mr Dar and witnesses in the village.
Major Gogoi says he decided to tie Mr Dar to the jeep in a ""fraction of a moment"" and subsequently claimed it saved 12 lives. Despite the length of Mr Dar's ordeal, he argues it created ""a window to move out of the area safely"".
The incident was filmed and shared on social media, causing uproar in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley.
The use of Mr Dar as a human shield was criticised around the world. Amnesty International described it as ""cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amounting to torture"".
The Indian government announced there would be an inquiry into the incident but on 22 May, before the inquiry had been completed, the army awarded Major Gogoi a commendation medal for, it said, his ""sustained efforts during counter-insurgency operations"".
This incident shows just how difficult India is finding it to keep a lid on unrest in Kashmir.
Indian army sources have told the BBC that morale among soldiers stationed in the valley is very low. Many any soldiers are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with their role in Kashmir, saying they fear they are effectively becoming an army of occupation.
Meanwhile, opposition to Indian rule in Kashmir appears to be deepening. That is reflected in the fact that Mr Dar was just one of 7% of eligible voters who actually voted in the by-election - the lowest turnout for decades.
""We are fighting a legacy of political betrayal, infiltration, rigging in local elections, cynical politics, bad governance, vested interests, religion and regional divides,"" one senior army officer in Kashmir told my colleague, Soutik Biswas, a few weeks ago.
The officer acknowledged how difficult it is to operate in an environment where many people want the army to withdraw and said that, despite efforts to reach out to Kashmiris, the army remains unpopular.
This weekend the chief of the Indian army, General Bipin Rawat, was clear why he wanted to honour Major Gogoi.  He told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that the medal was given as a way of boosting the morale of young officers.
Gen Rawat served for many years in Kashmir and, like many Indians, believes much of the opposition to Indian rule is orchestrated by Pakistan.  He described Major Gogoi's actions as an ""innovation"", arguing the armed forces have the right to self-defence and that by using Mr Dar as a human shield, he avoided the need to fire on the crowd.
""This is a proxy war and a proxy war is a dirty war. It is played in a dirty way. That is where innovation comes in. You fight a dirty war with innovations,"" he told PTI.
""People are throwing stones at us, people are throwing petrol bombs at us. If my men ask me what do we do, should I say, just wait and die?  I will come with a nice coffin with a national flag and I will send your bodies home with honour. Is it what I am supposed to tell them as chief?  I have to maintain the morale of my troops who are operating there,"" Gen Rawat said.
That's certainly what many Kashmiris fear will happen. They say that the award of the medal to Major Gogoi has deepened opposition to Indian rule and to the presence of the army.
Gen Rawat actually appears to be keen to see an escalation in the conflict in Kashmir. ""In fact,"" he told journalists, ""I wish these people, instead of throwing stones at us, were firing weapons at us. Then I would have been happy. Then I could do what I [want to do].""
This is an extraordinary sentiment and a measure of just how difficult India is finding it to keep order in its most restive province.
His worry is that Kashmiris are losing their fear of his troops. If that happens, he says, the country is doomed.
""Adversaries must be afraid of you and at the same time your people must be afraid of you,"" says Gen Rawat. ""We are a friendly army, but when we are called to restore law and order, people have to be afraid of us.""","Amidst ongoing violence in disputed Kashmir, a man named Farooq Ahmed Dar was allegedly beaten and tied to a jeep as a human shield by Indian army personnel during a by-election, sparking international condemnation and raising concerns about the treatment of civilians and army morale in the region."

Last week Hungary closed its border with Croatia and Serbia and refused to let any more migrants cross, citing security concerns. As a result, the migrants have been diverted to Slovenia on their way to western Europe.
Slovenia says it has been overwhelmed by the nearly 20,000 migrants that have arrived since Friday. It had said it could only take 2,500 migrants a day.
The Slovenian army and the police are working to manage the flow, but aid agencies have been warning of dire conditions as bottlenecks develop at border crossings along the route, just as temperatures are beginning to drop.
But there is no sign that the numbers of migrants and refugees is slowing.
A number of boats carrying around 140 people, including children, arrived at the RAF base at Akrotiri in Cyprus on Wednesday morning.
Many of the migrants heading through the Western Balkans are trying to reach Germany, which is predicting an influx of at least 800,000 asylum seekers this year. Some estimates put the number at over a million.
Many of those will have their asylum bids rejected and a government spokesman confirmed on Wednesday that it was considering the use of military planes to help speed up the deportation process.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said army transport planes would be used, but only if civilian aircraft were not available.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's domestic popularity has declined in recent weeks because of the influx into Germany.
And an opinion poll on Wednesday said the proportion of Germans who were extremely worried by the situation had risen from 40% in August to 54%.
However a separate poll of members of Mrs Merkel's conservative CDU party found that 82% were happy with her as their leader.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.","Migrants protesting lack of registration and basic necessities at a camp in Brezice, Slovenia, set their tents on fire, while the Greek coastguard searches for a capsized boat with 14 migrants near Samos, as EU leaders are summoned for a meeting to address the escalating migration crisis and countries like Hungary and Slovenia struggle to cope with the influx."

Some 13,000 people have left the area since Thursday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says.
The evacuation deal also includes government-held parts of Idlib province besieged by rebels.
The UN envoy for Syria says there are plans for peace talks on 8 February.
Some 7,000 people are still trapped in Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory. Conditions there are grim, with no access to food and shelter and minimal medical facilities.
Among those evacuated on Monday were 47 children trapped in an orphanage, children's charity Unicef said in a statement. Some were in a critical condition because of injuries or dehydration, the organisation added.
The evacuees also included seven-year-old Bana Alabed, whose home in eastern Aleppo was bombed and whose appeals for peace on Twitter were heard worldwide.
In a video she expressed relief at escaping the ""endless bombardment in Aleppo"".
After leaving Aleppo city, the evacuees will be moved to parts of Aleppo and Idlib provinces.
The operation restarted late on Sunday. It had stalled after armed men set fire to buses that were about to transport the sick and injured from the mainly Shia, government-held villages of Foah and Kefraya in Idlib province.
The Syrian Observatory said that 500 of the 4,000 villagers left the areas on Monday.
A rebel representative said hundreds of people would also be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya, two army-besieged rebel towns near the border with Lebanon, as part of the deal.
At the UN Security Council, the 15 members managed to overcome disagreements between Western nations and Russia and unanimously approved the resolution.
It requested the ""UN and other relevant institutions to carry out adequate, neutral monitoring"" of the mass evacuations from Aleppo.
Syria's envoy Bashar Jaafari spoke out against council members who he said had hidden agendas and intended ""to legitimise foreign interference, the changing of legitimate governments by force, or even using military force"".
For monitors to be deployed in Aleppo, they need permission from the Syrian government.
Meanwhile, a gunman killed the Russian ambassador to Turkey in Ankara. The attacker, identified as a police officer, shouted ""Don't forget Aleppo"".
Leaders of both countries, who brokered the deal for the evacuations, said the attack was a ""provocation"" aimed at hurting bilateral ties, and vowed to investigate the killing. It was not clear if the gunman acted alone or had links to any group.","Over 13,000 people have left Aleppo under an evacuation deal, including 47 children, after a previous attempt was halted due to rebel attacks on buses; UN peace talks are planned for February 8."

Afghan-born Qadri, Derbyshire's youngest Championship player, bowled tightly with the pink ball under the floodlights, taking 1-16 in 15 overs - including the maiden wicket of Andrew Salter, caught at slip for nine off 75 balls.
Bizarrely, Derbyshire sent out two nightwatchmen in Tom Taylor and Palladino for the last two overs at 21:10 BST, but both men survived to continue on Wednesday.

The lead investigator was seeking to clarify earlier comments by police that suggested some of the driver's actions were deliberate.
Band members Kris Leonard, River Reeves, Jack Dakin and Tomas Lowe died, along with manager Craig Tarry, 33, near Stockholm on 13 February.
Lars Berglund said the driver's ""only intention was to avoid a crash"".
Witnesses reported seeing the car going though red lights and barriers before the Warrington band's car plunged 80ft (24m) into a canal off a bridge, the middle section of which was raised.
Mr Berglund told Mirror reporter Rhian Lubin: ""I have not suggested that [the driver] was doing this in order to kill himself or the band. I said he was making a move from the right lane to the left lane and that was not accidental.
""We can see the brake lights. His intention was to stop the car. But maybe his speed was too high and it was too late.""
Earlier, a Stockholm police spokesman said: ""It looks like he [the driver] tried to drive past red lights, barriers.
""All the witnesses thought it looked like he was trying to drive past... there weren't supposed to be cars on the left.
'It is a possibility he deliberately crashed the car, but he may have misunderstood the signs.
""[It is] still subject to investigation and we are still waiting for results of technical investigation too.""
Police have previously confirmed the driver, who has not been identified, had no traces of alcohol or drugs and said it would have been very difficult to pass two lines of parked cars if he was asleep.
The car, carrying the four members of the band and their manager, was recovered from the canal under the E4 highway bridge in Sodertalje, Sweden.
In the week after the accident, the band reached number one in the iTunes chart following a social media campaign backed by Oasis singer Liam Gallagher and Tim Burgess from The Charlatans.
A concert in the band's memory at Warrington's Parr Hall on 2 April has now sold out.
The gig, which will feature friends and bands they have played with, will be hosted in their Warrington hometown by BBC Radio 1 DJ Phil Taggart.","The lead investigator stated that the driver's intention was to avoid a crash, not to deliberately cause harm, as initially suggested by police, following the tragic accident involving a Warrington band."

Mr Hands said officials would be able to choose the type of products to be covered by agreements.
The union operates alongside the EU's single market and free trade area.
It comes after the Brexit secretary said the UK would consider paying for ""best possible"" single market access.
The customs union includes all 28 EU nations, but also Turkey, Monaco, San Marino, Andorra and non-EU UK territories such as the Channel Islands.
They enjoy free trade with each other, but must impose the same tariffs on goods from nations outside the pact and are barred from doing bilateral trade deals with other countries.
Bloomberg news agency published remarks Mr Hands made in an interview this week in which he said the ""history of international trade has got all kinds of examples of customs unions"".
He said the UK could be selective about which individual sectors it wished to be covered by any customs union arrangement.
Mr Hands added: ""You can choose which markets, which products the customs unions affect and which they don't, so there isn't a binary thing of being inside the customs union or outside of the customs union.""
As the pound posted its fifth consecutive week of gains against the euro, Mr Hands's words were cited by financial market commentators as further evidence that fears over a ""hard Brexit"" were easing.
In the Commons on Thursday, Brexit Secretary David Davis had said the ""major criterion"" was getting the best access for goods and services to the European market.
Later, in a speech to CBI Wales in Cardiff, Mr Davis sought to reassure business leaders that immigration controls after Brexit will not be imposed ""in a way that it is contrary to the national and economic interest"".
But Brexit-backing Tory MP Peter Bone said ""people would be absolutely outraged"" if the UK continued to pay the EU after Brexit.

They say that the animals, which live in the Taimyr Peninsula in the northernmost tip of Russia, are being affected by rising temperatures and human activity.
This is causing the animals to change their annual migration patterns.
The research has been presented at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).
""There is a substantial decline - and we are also seeing this with other wild reindeer declining rapidly in other parts of the world,"" said Andrey Petrov, who runs the Arctic Centre at the University of Northern Iowa, US.
The Taimyr herd is one of the most monitored groups of reindeer in the world. The animals have been tracked for nearly 50 years by aerial surveys and more recently by satellite imagery.
The population reached a peak of one million in 2000, but this latest research suggests that there are now only 600,000 reindeer.
""Climate change is at least one of the variables,"" explained Prof Petrov.
""We know in the last two decades that we have had an increase in temperatures of about 1.5C overall. And that definitely impacts migration patterns.""
Industrial development is increasing in the region, which is also changing the animals' distribution.
The researchers found that in the summer, the reindeer were moving east to avoid human activity. But they were also shifting north and to higher elevations.
The team thinks this is to try to get to cooler ground and also to avoid the mosquitoes that are booming as the region gets warmer and wetter.
""They just move and move and move to escape them,"" said Prof Petrov.
This is extending the distance that the animals have to migrate between winter and summer.
""They now have to travel much longer distances to reach those areas with their newborn calves, and that means there is an increase in calf mortality.""
He added that rivers in the region were also growing in size, making them more dangerous for the animals as they had to swim rather than walk across them.
In addition, food in the summer grounds is becoming more scarce, especially as the animals move to higher elevations.
Prof Petrov said it was important to try to halt the decline.
""Reindeer are tremendously important for biodiversity - they are part of the Arctic food chain and without them other species would be in trouble,"" he explained.
""But on the other hand, in all the areas they inhabit, they are vital for peopleâ€™s survival.
""Thousands and thousands of people rely on wild reindeer; it is the basis of their subsistence economy. So it's about human sustainability too.""

Indian troops killed six militants during a four-day battle at the base in Punjab, close to the Pakistan border.
Foreign secretaries of the two sides are due to hold peace talks next week.
Although India has not officially announced any dates, Indian media reports say the meeting is due to take place on 14-15 January in Islamabad.
The assault on the Pathankot base started on Saturday, when a group of gunmen - wearing Indian army uniforms - entered residential quarters on the air base.
Seven Indian troops and six militants were killed in the gun battle.
Hopes for Delhi-Islamabad detente were raised in late December after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi  paid an unexpected visit to his counterpart Nawaz Sharif  on his way back from Afghanistan and the two sides announced plans to resume peace talks.
But the attack has come as a blow to the peace initiative.
""Pathankot terror attack has put renewed focus on cross-border terrorism,"" Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Vikas Swarup told a press conference in Delhi on Thursday.
""The government's policy towards Pakistan is clear and consistent. India wants friendly relations with all its neighbours including Pakistan,"" he said, adding that ""India will not tolerate cross-border terror"".
On Tuesday, Mr Modi urged an ""immediate"" response to the Pathankot attack after Mr Sharif telephoned him to discuss the incident.
Mr Sharif promised that Pakistan would take ""prompt and decisive action against the terrorists"", Indian officials said.
India's Press Information Bureau said India had provided Pakistan with ""specific and actionable"" information on the attack.
Earlier in the week, the United Jihad Council - a coalition of more than a dozen militant groups fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir - claimed that its ""national highway squad"" was behind the attack.
The council, based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, is headed by Syed Salahuddin who also leads Hizb-ul Mujahidin, the longest surviving Kashmiri militant group.
Some Indian security officials have suggested the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed was to blame.

The trial of Edwin McLaren began in September 2015 with the 15 jurors needed for a Scottish criminal trial and ended more than a year and a half later with just 12.
There were concerns that if they had lost another juror the case would have collapsed.
That is what happened with another mammoth fraud case at the Old Bailey in London in 2005.
The London Underground Jubilee Line case heard evidence for about 140 days over a 21-month period before one juror ""went on strike"".
The court had already lost two jurors when one became pregnant and another was arrested for benefit fraud.
After missing work for almost two years one juror became aware that he owed thousands in pension contributions, which his employer had not been liable for while he was on the jury.
He refused to take part in the jury until his financial situation was sorted out, claiming loss of earnings threatened his ability to pay Oxford university fees for a course he was due to start.
The Attorney General in England at the time, Lord Goldsmith, brought forward legislation to allow complex fraud trials to be held without juries.
It was defeated in the Lords two years later with peers arguing that trial by jury was a bedrock of the criminal justice system.
The UK government had said major trials put too much pressure on jurors.
""The use of a jury is a bulwark of not just Scottish justice but British justice and I would say there should be a presumption that the jury system continues,"" Douglas Mill, former chief executive of the Law Society of Scotland, told the BBC.
But Mr Mill added that fraud was now so ""specialised"" that the police, the Crown office prosecutors and defence lawyers all had experts who dealt only with such cases.
He said the only people who were not specialists were the jury.
""It is left to 15 very lay people who are being asked to assimilate vast numbers of documents over an endless number of days,"" he said.
""Is that in the interests of justice? Big question.""
Law lecturer Andrew Tickell also said fraud cases were complex and difficult to follow.
In the case of Edwin McLaren, the indictment carried 29 separate charges and it was the Crown's job to prove every one.
This required a large number of witnesses and mountains of documents.
The Glasgow Caledonian University law lecturer said: ""If the Crown is going to bring forward a mega case then it really has to bring forward quite substantial evidence to buttress that claim.
""Juries have to decide on the guilt in the cases and so have to sit through many months of evidence. That has real challenges for them and challenges for the justice system as a whole.
""Certainly in terms of very serious cases involving complicated financial concepts and instruments that the ordinary person might not be familiar with then you might well ask 'is it right for 15 ordinary members of the public to spend a year of their life trying to get on top of these questions?'
""Is this most cost effective, and effective generally, way of delivering justice in these cases?""
Mr Tickell put forward the alternative of an expert bench of judges who know the area and are able to identify fraud when they see it.
But he said: ""On the other hand, some people would say having a jury of your peers deciding your fate in the most serious of cases, with massive prison sentences at the end of the line if you are convicted, that's a matter of principle.
""We apply that in murder cases, in very serious fraud cases some people would argue we should maintain that safeguard as well.""
He added: ""I would imagine the Scottish government and a range of politicians may look at this case and say 'is this value for money'?
""Is it the best way to deliver justice? I'm not sure on either of those two tests we are delivering that in Scotland today.""","The trial of Edwin McLaren, involving 29 charges, faced challenges due to jury attrition, with concerns it could have collapsed if another juror left, similar to a London fraud case that lasted 140 days and lost a juror, leading to the UK considering legislation to allow complex fraud trials without juries, but this was ultimately rejected, raising questions about the suitability of jury trials for such complex cases and the cost-effectiveness and fairness of relying on laypeople to understand and judge financial fraud."

Evan Ebel's bracelet, worn as a condition of his release to confirm he was obeying curfew, signalled on 14 March that it had been tampered with.
But officials did not determine he had absconded until five days later - hours before Tom Clements was shot dead.
Ebel, 28, was killed in a shootout with Texas police three days after that.
Also, on Monday Colorado officials acknowledged Ebel was released from prison four years too early due to an apparent courthouse clerical error.
The confusion stemmed from whether he had been ordered to serve a consecutive or simultaneous prison sentence for assaulting a prison officer while incarcerated for an earlier crime.
Clements's death was the second in a series of three killings of US justice officials, including a Texas prosecutor and his deputy, just weeks apart.
According to court documents released on Tuesday in Colorado, Ebel had followed the conditions of his parole without incident since his release in January, checking in by phone every day and even once calling parole officials because no-one had requested a weekly drug test.
He worked for his father, a well-connected lawyer, and lived in housing his father had found.
""From 28 January to the middle of March, we had an individual who was calling in every day, who was employed, who showed no indication that he would do the kind of things that we now know,"" said Tim Hand, a spokesman for Colorado's parole division.
But on the afternoon of 14 March, the electronic radio monitoring bracelet he had been ordered to wear registered a ""tamper alert"". Later, he failed to report to officials as required to have the device repaired.
Parole officials did not speak with Ebel's father until 18 March. He told them he feared his son had absconded and gave them permission to search the younger Ebel's apartment.
The next day, officers found Ebel had fled - and taken a large amount of clothing. They listed him as absconded and obtained a warrant for his arrest.
That evening Clements, 58, was gunned down after he was called to the front door of his home near the city of Colorado Springs.
Authorities now say Ebel used the same gun to kill Clements that he used in the 21 March shootout in Texas in which he was shot dead by police.
Ebel is also suspected in the 17 March killing of Nathan Leon, a pizza delivery man and father of three.
Ebel first went to prison in 2005 for robbery, assault and car jacking. He was sentenced to three separate prison terms, all to be served at the same time, and scheduled for release this year.
While in prison he is said to have joined a violent white supremacist prison gang, and official documents state his body was covered with Nazi-themed tattoos.
Also while incarcerated, in 2008 he pleaded guilty to assaulting a prison officer and threatening his family. For this he was sentenced to up to four additional years.
According to court transcripts, Ebel told the judge that would make him 33 when he was released. The judge told him that four extra years was fair.
But in a subsequent court filing, the term was not specified as consecutive, meaning his sentence was automatically recorded as simultaneous. Prison officials say they had no way of knowing the judge had intended to keep Ebel behind bars beyond 28 January.
In a statement, the chief judge and administrator of the judicial district said they regretted the oversight and extended ""condolences to the families of Mr Nathan Leon and Mr Tom Clements"".

Turkey reacted angrily when Germany's constitutional court banned Mr Erdogan from appearing by video link at Sunday's demonstration in Cologne, accusing Berlin of infringing freedom of expression.
Although officially aimed at celebrating the defeat of the military coup, the protest was also viewed by many in Germany as a sign of the leverage Mr Erdogan enjoys as a result of his support among Germany's large Turkish-origin diaspora.
The spat also comes as Germans are torn between fear for the survival of the EU's migrant deal with Turkey and dismay at Mr Erdogan's perceived post-coup crackdown on opponents.
""This is how long the reach of Erdogan's arm is,"" says a report in Der Spiegel on the Cologne demonstration, pointing out that the president's AK Party won a bigger share of the vote among German Turks in last year's parliamentary elections than the 49% it garnered at home.
Some German Turkish-language media reflect the mood of support for Mr Erdogan the coup has generated among many both at home and in Germany.
""They shook Europe,"" says the Post Aktuel newspaper of the Cologne demonstration, adding that thousands had expressed their anger at the coup, ""despite the best efforts of German politicians to create obstacles"".
Its tone mirrors that of pro-government newspapers in Turkey, such as Aksam, where a commentary urges Turks to ""put aside their own slogans for a while and try to ensure that the language of unity dominates"".
But there is dissent too. Turkey's secularist Sozcu tabloid accuses the government of having ""suspended democracy"" and leading Turkey into ""honourable loneliness"" on the international stage.
Some German Turkish media also share the misgivings about Mr Erdogan's response to the coup.
The Yeni Ozgur Politika website describes the organisers of the Cologne demonstration, the pro-Erdogan Union of European Turkish Democrats, as ""fascists"", and reports extensively on three counter-protests, including one by German Kurds.
A commentary by Sueddeutsche Zeitung's Turkey correspondent, Mike Szymanski, thinks the new ""mistrust"" between Germany is down to ""one man"" - Mr Erdogan, whom it accuses of reshaping Turkey into a ""one-man country"".
Mr Erdogan also appears to know that it is ""pictures of full migrant boats in the Aegean"" that will really ""clobber"" Angela Merkel in her campaign for re-election next year, he adds.
The jittery mood has been fanned by a demand by Turkey's Foreign Minister Mehmet Cavusoglu that the EU lift visa requirements for Turkish nationals.
This is Ankara's key condition for sticking to the migrant deal, but one the EU insists cannot be fulfilled unless Turkey modifies its terrorism and other laws.
""A compromise appears almost impossible,"" says tabloid Bild's website in its top story on what will happen if Turkey follows through on its threat to cancel the refugee deal. ""Germany is faced with a dramatic decision.""
Many feel there is no need for Germany to buckle under the pressure.
Sueddeutsche Zeitung's politics editor, Heribert Prantl, points out that the German constitutional court was right to deny Mr Erdogan the opportunity to address the Cologne rally, saying the constitution's guarantee of basic rights such as free expression only applies to citizens and not to foreign heads of state.
Die Welt's economics editor, Dorothea Sims, believes that despite Ankara's ""menacing gestures"", the EU money promised to Turkey in return for the migrant deal means Turkey has ""too much to lose"" in the case of a complete breach in relations, even if the EU never grants visa freedom.

Arriving at 01:00 (22:00 GMT Wednesday) in cars, they fired on a traffic police checkpoint before attacking a media building and a school.
An Islamist group said it had launched a suicide attack to avenge attacks by security forces on Muslim women.
Chechnya's Moscow-backed president said the situation was under control.
Ramzan Kadyrov said none of the attackers had escaped.
The controversial Chechen strongman has suppressed rebel activity in Chechnya since Russia ousted the separatist government there at the beginning of the century.
The attack was a rare breach of the heavy security which surrounds Grozny.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said from Moscow he was confident Chechen security forces could handle the militants by themselves.
This is the most serious violence in Grozny for some time and will be another worry for President Putin, amid a serious downturn in the Russian economy, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow.
Mr Putin prides himself on bringing stability to Chechnya after two bloody, separatist wars there since the break-up of the Soviet Union, our correspondent adds.
Three traffic policemen were killed as they tried to stop the gunmen's cars, Mr Kadyrov said.
Nine militants died in the subsequent fighting, the Chechen leader said.
According to the Russian government, a further four people died and 21 were injured during the fighting.
Inhabitants of the city woke to the sight of smoke rising from the gutted shell of the publishing house, where both Chechen and federal Russian media had offices.
Covered stalls at a market were also burned in the fighting.
There were no reports of any children being inside the school when the rebels seized it.
Mobile phone videos posted during the night attested to the ferocity of the fighting.
An Associated Press reporter saw the publishing house in flames and heard the continuing sound of gunfire before dawn.
The same reporter also saw the body of someone in civilian clothing in the street near the building.
""Not one bandit managed to get out,"" Mr Kadyrov later announced. ""I directly ran the operation myself.""
In a grainy video posted on YouTube, a gunman said he and a group of others had attacked the city in a ""revenge operation"" to avenge Muslim women harassed by the security forces.
He said the attack had been carried out on the instructions of Chechen rebel figure Aslan Byutukayev, an associate of Doku Umarov, the rebel leader believed to have been killed earlier this year.
The attack on Grozny came hours before President Putin gave his annual state of the nation address at the Kremlin.
Dmitry Trenin, who heads the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in a Twitter post that the night attack in Grozny looked ""senseless except as an attempt to embarrass Putin hours before his annual address"".","Islamic militants attacked a traffic police checkpoint, media building, and school in Grozny, Chechnya, killing several and claiming to have carried out a suicide bombing in response to security force attacks on Muslim women, amidst heavy Russian presence and President Putin's assertion of control."

Sheringham has been out of management since leaving Stevenage - his first managerial job - in February 2016 after winning just seven of his games as boss.
Previous Robins boss Luke Williams left his role soon after the club's relegation was confirmed, having won two of their final 11 league matches with him in charge.

Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself at his family farm in Greater Manchester two days after his arrest.
His parents, Nick and Jane Lawton, are urging the Government to change the law, which says 17 year-olds are not children in custody.
The Home Office believes current laws are adequate.
Joe was arrested when police stopped him as he drove his new car home from a party last August.
He was kept overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents' knowledge because he was not classed as a child.
Two days later he took his own life, using a shotgun from the family farm. The police charge sheet was at his feet when his father found him.
Joe's parents believe they could have given him more support had they been able to see him in a police cell.
In a statement on the change.org website, Mr and Mrs Lawton said: ""He was just 17 and had made a bad decision to drive home after a party. Two days later Joe took his own life.
""We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed.""
They added: ""The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult whilst in custody is an anomaly of British law.  Once they are charged they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense.""

Labour's Lord Alli said its passage meant ""my life and many others will be better today than it was yesterday"".
But Tory peer Lord Framlingham said the ""ill-thought through"" change had been ""bulldozed"" through Parliament.
Peers approved the principle of same-sex marriage last month, despite efforts by opponents to ""wreck"" the legislation.
MPs had earlier done the same, in the face of opposition from many Conservatives, the Church of England and other faith groups.
Supporters of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill wore pink carnations during Monday's proceedings in the Lords, during which a series of minor amendments - including one relating to pension benefits for same-sex couples - were proposed.
Government minister Lady Stowell said the bill ""puts right something which is wrong"" and had been improved by detailed scrutiny in the Upper House. ""I can't claim to be a gay rights campaigner, but I am a firm believer in justice and fairness,"" she said.
But the Gay Marriage No Thanks group claimed it had been prevented from mounting an advertising campaign around Parliament after its truck was vandalised and its driver threatened.
After clearing the Lords, the bill will return to the Commons for a short debate on government amendments before the Commons begins its summer recess on Thursday.

The Portadown Times published results from what it said was an ""independent"" poll ahead of May's general election.
But it failed to acknowledge that the survey had actually been commissioned by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
Mr Nesbitt said the article ""appears to have skewed"" the election result.
The article suggested that the gap in support between the DUP and Sinn Féin had narrowed.
The results put the DUP candidate David Simpson in first place with 30.7% of the vote, with Sinn Féin in second place on 28.1%.
The Ulster Unionist candidate, Jo-Anne Dobson, was third in the poll, with 25% of the vote.
Mr Simpson held his House of Commons seat for Upper Bann in the election with 15,430 votes, with Mrs Dobson polling 13,166 votes to finish in second place.
The Ulster Unionist Party said the publication of the article suggested to readers that a vote for Mrs Dobson would have would ""split the pro-union vote, and risk the seat being taken by Sinn Féin"".
The Independent Press Standards Office (IPSO) upheld Mr Nesbitt's complaint that the newspaper's description of the poll as ""independent"" had misled readers.
IPSO said the Portadown Times had also failed to inform readers that the poll had been conducted six weeks before it was published.
Mr Nesbitt said his party's canvassing team felt the publication of the ""out-of-date"" survey had ""provoked a dramatic mood-swing on the doorstep"".
""I have no doubt David Simpson will do the decent thing and call a by-election, so the people of Upper Bann can vote without the artificial shadow of fear hanging over their ballot papers,"" he added.

validation-49,17.374,59,3.40,9.029,"Speaking before a crowd of more than 11,000 students and locals at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, Donald Trump made no mention of Texas Senator Ted Cruz.","Summarize in one sentence:
It was practically the first time he'd stopped talking about his presidential rival in the week since their once chummy relationship soured amid a flurry of exchanged insults and questioned political credentials.
Despite a storm of tweets over the weekend blasting Mr Cruz and a round of insult-laden television interviews on Sunday, it's perhaps not surprising that Mr Trump held his tongue at the university founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell in 1971.
Both Mr Cruz and Mr Trump are battling for the sizeable religious conservative vote in Iowa - which holds its first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses in two weeks - and it's a crowd that Mr Cruz usually seems more comfortable with.
Last March, Texas Senator Ted Cruz launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination at Liberty University, speaking intimately about his faith and his father, a firebrand evangelical pastor.
Mr Trump, on the other hand, doesn't quite have the same religious bona fides, despite his best attempts. Last September, he proudly held up his childhood Bible at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC. And at one point during his hour-long speech at Liberty, he tried to cite a biblical passage about faith and liberty.
Unfortunately for Mr Trump, he referenced ""Two Corinthians"" instead of ""Second Corinthians"".
The crowd laughed.
""I always think it's entertaining when people try to throw the Bible into their speeches,"" Josh Schumacher, a student in his third year at Liberty, said after the speech. ""I think it's sometimes just a ploy to get us to buy into what they're saying.""
Mr Trump did benefit from a glowing introduction from Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr, however, who praised the businessman as one of the ""greatest visionaries of our time"" and likened him to his famous father.
""Trump can't be bought,"" he said. ""He's not a puppet on a string like so many other candidates.""
That could be read as a tacit boost of Mr Trump over Mr Cruz, as Mr Trump has recently attacked the Texas senator for being in the thrall of his big-ticket campaign donors.
Once upon a time, Mr Cruz and Mr Trump had nothing but kind words for each other. Mr Cruz invited Mr Trump to join him in speaking at a rally in front of the US Capitol, protesting the US-Iran nuclear arms agreement.
And while other candidates criticised the businessman for his call to temporarily close the US border to all Muslims, Mr Cruz was more restrained.
Mr Cruz said he wouldn't engage in a ""cage match"" with Mr Trump, tweeting that the New Yorker was ""terrific"".
But as the Iowa caucuses approach, and Mr Cruz and Mr Trump are locked in a battle for first place according to polls, the sparks have flown.
For the past week, Mr Trump has questioned Mr Cruz's eligibility for the presidency, given that he was born of an American mother on Canadian soil.
Mr Cruz has returned fire, saying Mr Trump embraces the liberal values of his New York City home town. Their acrimony was one of the headlines of the Republican presidential debate last Thursday.
Since then Trump has attacked the senator as a hypocrite and a ""nasty man"".
""Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him,"" Mr Trump said on Sunday. ""He's got an edge that's not good. You can't make deals with people like that.""
Mr Cruz responded on Monday by comparing Mr Trump unfavourably to conservative patron saint Ronald Reagan and saying he is unqualified for the presidency.
David Barton, who chairs a group supporting Mr Cruz, went one step further.
""Donald Trump's about-face, negative attacks on Ted Cruz are proof he has neither the temperament nor judgement to lead our country,"" he said in a statement. ""It proves Trump is the ultimate opportunist.""
Dylan Engel, Liberty student, said that he supports both Mr Cruz and Mr Trump, and finds the growing rivalry between the two upsetting.
""I like how outspoken Trump is,"" he said. ""I believe today we need to fight political correctness. We're being torn apart from the inside.""
He added, however, that he's impressed that Mr Cruz hasn't backed down from Mr Trump's attacks.
""Ted Cruz stood his ground,"" he said.
It seems the Trump-Cruz battle is just warming up.","After their contentious relationship soured, President Donald Trump refrained from criticizing his presidential rival, Senator Ted Cruz, at Liberty University, where Cruz is more comfortable among religious conservatives, during a visit where Trump received a glowing introduction from Falwell Jr., who praised him as a ""greatest visionary."""
validation-50,16.453,57,3.46,8.831,Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was written with a deliberate lack of clarity - it does not say whether it can be revoked once it has been triggered.,"Summarize in one sentence:
The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May says there is no turning back from the triggering of Article 50, which starts the process of leaving the EU.
Reality Check verdict: The government is clear that it respects the result of the referendum, so it argues that any debate is theoretical. However, the question of whether Article 50 is irrevocable is the subject of legal dispute.
As a result, the UK government has been unable to make any definitive legal statements on the issue.
The Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has said ""My understanding is that it is irrevocable,"" while the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said in December 2016: ""Is it irrevocable? I don't know.""
In the recent UK Supreme Court case on Article 50, both sides assumed that it was irrevocable and the court judgement concluded: ""We are content to proceed on the basis that that is correct, without expressing any view of our own.""
So this is not an issue that has been formally tested in a UK court.
But European Council President Donald Tusk has said that he believes Article 50 can be reversed.
When asked if the UK could unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 notification during the next two years, he said, ""Formally, legally, yes.""
Lord Kerr - the former British ambassador to the EU, who helped draft Article 50 - agreed.
""You can change your mind while the process is going on,"" he said.
He acknowledged that this might annoy the rest of the EU, and be seen as a huge waste of time.
""They might try to extract a political price,"" Lord Kerr said, ""but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.""
The distinction between political and legal opinion on this issue is critical. The politics might become way too complicated if the UK tried to change its mind.
But who might have the final legal say on what could yet become a critical question?
Article 50 is a piece of European law, so the ultimate arbiter on this issue is the European Court of Justice.
There is an ongoing case in Dublin at the moment that is seeking to refer the question of irrevocability to the European Court to get a definitive answer.
One other point is worth bearing in mind: everyone is talking about a two-year period for negotiating under Article 50, at the end of which the UK would leave the EU.
But Article 50 does provide for that two-year period to be extended, if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agreed.
No-one is advocating that, but it remains a legal possibility.
The argument that Article 50 cannot be reversed once it has been triggered has not been tested in court.
The rest of the EU has said it does not want the UK to leave, but - politically speaking - it would be very difficult to revoke notification of Article 50, and the current UK government says it has no intention of doing so.

This may suggest would-be adult apprentices are being put off by having to borrow to fund their courses, says an education charity.
Official targets are for 25,000 people this year to borrow about Â£4,000 for higher and advanced apprenticeships.
The government says numbers may pick up later in the year.
It points out that not all apprenticeships start at the beginning of the academic year.
Until this year apprentices have not had to contribute to the costs of their training - but from September 2013 some 25,000 over-24s on advanced or higher level apprenticeships have been expected to take out a loan to be paid back once they are earning.
A further 50,000 adults are expected to have their training costs paid by their employers.
Trainees under 24 still do not have to pay.
Figures published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on Thursday show that in the first quarter of 2013-14 only 404 people had applied for the loans.
NIACE says a second set of official figures, published on Thursday show that by contrast some 197,000 people were enrolled on higher and advanced level apprenticeships in 2012-13.
NIACE is concerned that the low uptake of the loans may indicate that would-be trainees are being deterred by being required to part-fund their courses.
The charity's chief executive David Hughes said: ""We have continually voiced our concerns about the impact loans for apprenticeships would have.
""However as today's figures show, that impact has been even more severe than anyone first feared.""
He called on the government to take ""urgent action"", including writing off some loans and subsidising under-represented groups on higher and advanced level apprenticeships.

We are keeping a close watch on the data and the implications for the apprenticeship programme.""","The low number of loan applications for higher and advanced apprenticeships, according to an education charity, could be deterring potential apprentices from pursuing courses due to the financial burden, with only 404 applicants in the first quarter of 2013-14, despite government targets and loans starting in September 2013."

The huge cache was viewable online for a few days in April, but the motoring organisation said that it contained no ""sensitive"" information.
However, a security researcher who analysed the leak said he found details like email addresses, names and parts of payment card numbers.
He said said it was a ""very serious incident"" the AA needed to address.
AA president Edmund King said it first learned about the problem with data used for its online shop on 22 April. Soon after discovery, the firm that runs the shop on the AA's behalf was told about the problem.
""They identified the vulnerability and the issue was resolved on 25 April,"" he said.
A server ""misconfiguration"" was blamed for giving access to two back-up files that contained information about orders for maps and other products from retailers and some customers.
The AA said it investigated, sampled the data and, because it was not sensitive and only accessed a few times, ended the investigation.
The motoring group has started an independent inquiry into the breach and also told the UK's Information Commissioner about it.
""We take any data issues incredibly seriously and would like to reassure our AA Shop customers that their payment details have not been compromised,"" said Mr King.
Security researcher Troy Hunt alerted the BBC to the existence of the leak last week.
At that time, the AA said it related to shop orders and contained no sensitive information.
Mr Hunt, who runs a website dedicated to data breaches called Have I Been Pwned, persisted with his investigation, obtained a copy of the back-ups and subjected them to a deeper analysis.
He found 117,000 unique email addresses in them as well as names, net addresses as well as credit card types, expiry dates and the final four digits of the card.
A separate analysis by researcher Scott Helme for the Motherboard website found the same data in the cache.
""I have confirmed with many Have I Been Pwned subscribers in the data and they have verified that it's accurate,"" said Mr Hunt. ""They're customers of the AA and they never received a notification about the data exposure.
""At no point does their statement acknowledge the severity of the exposed data nor that they failed to notify customers when learning of the exposure,"" he said.
He added that discussions with the Information Commissioner might take a ""decidedly different tone"" when it learned about the customer data in the cache.

Michelle Barnes, 33, from Cumbria, was serving a two-year sentence for drug offences at Low Newton Prison, Durham, when she died in December.
The inquest heard that Ms Barnes had hoped to keep the baby with her.
However, Low Newton has no mother and baby unit, and she was unable to get a transfer to a prison which does.
Ms Barnes - who found out she was pregnant while serving her sentence - had a history of mental health problems and self harming, the inquest jury was told.
Cumbria County Council had begun care proceedings as it had ""concerns"" about her as a mother.
Her solicitor, Victoria Rowson, said: ""Her intention was to be a good mother to her child"".
However, an interim care order was made after the baby was born in hospital.
Social worker, Sara Driscoll, said:  ""It was not a decision taken lightly at all.

Nobel prize-winning geneticist Sir Paul Nurse told BBC Newsnight experts ""are being derided and pushed back"".
Mr Gove says he had economists mostly in mind when he said ""people in this country have had enough of experts"".
But he admitted some people may have felt ""licensed"" by his remarks to challenge all forms of expertise.
Mr Gove made the controversial remarks in an interview with Sky's Faisal Islam three weeks before last year's EU referendum.
Michael Gove was justice secretary at the time and a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign.
Critics claimed Mr Gove was whipping up an anti-intellectual mood with parallels to Donald Trump's assault on media and other sources of information.
Mr Gove said his remarks were taken out of context because Mr Islam interrupted him before he was able to clarify that he was referring to ""organizations with acronyms who had got things wrong in the past"".
He told Newsnight he had failed to express himself more carefully because it was ""a high profile, high intensity, high tension, high nervousness, encounter"".
He insisted he did not regret using the word ""expert"" but added: ""One of the things that is occasionally irritating is that people assume that what I was saying was a blanket rejection of facts, evidence, rigour - when in fact what I was trying to do was to say look let's simply not take arguments at face value, just because someone works for a prestigious organisation.""
He conceded that some people may have felt encouraged by his comments to cast doubt on all forms of expertise. ""It may be that there are some people out there who think that that I'm giving them licence to operate in that way. Who's to say?""
He added: ""I would hope that people looking at my career would say whatever that phrase may have encouraged or licensed, actually the man uttering it was someone who believed in more knowledge and more critical thinking - not less.""
But Sir Paul, a former president of Britain's top scientific body, the Royal Society, said even if Mr Gove had meant to cast doubt primarily on economics, he had been ""irresponsible"" not to clarify his remarks.
He said the comment ""spilled over into all sorts of other areas where experts have an enormous contribution to make to the proper running of society"".
""The fact that experts have been derided in this way does have an effect in undermining science and scientific evidence.""
Sir Paul said the British public still has high levels of trust in scientists but we are living in a period where ""opinion is on the front foot"".
""Those who are expert, who have the knowledge, who have the intellectual ability to dissect these difficult problems, are being derided and pushed back,"" he said.
""My view about this is that it cannot last for very long, because opinion is not built on firm foundations and it rapidly falls apart. And I think we're seeing that already with, for example, Mr Trump.
""Science is built to last. Opinions are not built to last.""

The subway stops near Wall Street are still crammed in the mornings yet financial firms in New York - once the centre of the money universe - aren't expanding the way they used to.
Companies in far-flung states such as Arizona and Texas are seeing the rise in financial jobs instead.
The shift in part reflects population trends in the US, where states in the south and west - often dubbed Sun Belt states - are growing faster than their counterparts in the north.
It's also driven by growth in insurance, investment advice and consumer lending jobs, over the trading and securities roles historically based in New York.
Just as important, companies say, is that new technology and the rise of online banking means they can look more broadly when making location decisions.
""You don't need to go into a bank anymore. You don't need a brick-and-mortar building. You can do it from anywhere,"" says Gay Meyer, assistant vice president for regional human resources at the banking and insurance company USAA.
""That allows us as a company to think outside of, 'We have to be in New York or have to be in Chicago'.""
As the economic recovery takes hold and low interest rates persist, demand for home loans, credit cards and other products has picked up.
That's translated into jobs. The number of finance and insurance jobs in the US expanded by 1.8% over the 12 months that ended in March, finally rebounding to pre-financial crisis levels.
New York remains home to about 8% of those positions. But at the end of 2014, Texas overtook it as the state with the highest number of jobs in the sector.
Meyer is based in Arizona, a desert state on the border with Mexico that is better known for the Grand Canyon than banking. But over the 12 months to March, hiring for finance and insurance jobs grew faster than any other state in the country.
Its rise as a regional financial hub is fuelled by expansions from companies such as USAA, State Farm and Charles Schwab, which have been drawn to the area by affordability, booming population and a large pool of university graduates and potential recruits.
USAA, an insurance and banking firm that serves military and veteran families all over the world, hired nearly 600 people in Arizona last year, as demand for credit cards and mortgages boomed, Meyer said.
Forty minutes south, insurance giant State Farm hired about 2,000 people in 2016 and expects to bring on a similar number this year, in roles such as customer service, sales and IT, said Naomi Johnson, a State Farm public affairs specialist. She transferred to the Phoenix-area campus last June after working for the company for 16 years in her home state of New York.
Johnson, 39, said she's seen the way the job growth is boosting the local economy, spurring new food and shopping spots to open.
She regularly gets calls from builders, checking on hiring - the campus now holds about 6,600 and the firm is aiming for 10,000 - as they start new housing projects.
""I'm constantly sharing that information because they're preparing for this influx of people,"" she says.
New York leaders are aware their lead is slipping.
In 2015, the business association Partnership for New York City published a report titled At Risk: New York's Future as the World Financial Capital.
It called for ""public actions"", such as tax breaks and investment in transport and housing, to keep New York competitive with international rivals and the smaller US cities nipping at its heels.
Now banks are cheering signs of looser regulation under US President Donald Trump.
The tumult caused by the UK vote to leave the European Union last summer has also fuelled hopes that London's loss could be the Big Apple's gain.
""There are a lot of discussions with people saying Prague, Amsterdam may be the next financial centre in Europe, but meanwhile the US may get its own share as well,"" says Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the research institute at payrolls processor, ADP.
""Brexit may actually make New York more of a centre.""
But the momentum outside of New York is unlikely to stop. ADP announced its own expansion in Arizona last year with plans for 1,500 jobs.
Ascensus, a financial company headquartered in Pennsylvania that handles back-office operations for financial advisors, plans to open an office in Arizona this year with about 170 people and room for more.
Chief executive Bob Guillocheau said the industry is in a good position, as the country ages and relies more on private accounts to pay for retirement, college and health care.
For his firm, which provides record keeping and administrative services for the accounts, the opportunities to grow are ""sort of limitless"".
But it won't be happening in New York, he says.
""I grew up in New York. I know that New York has a tremendous amount to offer, but given the nature of our business... it's not that we need to be in New York City to do that.""","Financial firms in Arizona and Texas, traditionally overlooked as hubs for Wall Street activities, are experiencing growth due to factors like southern US population boom, increased demand for insurance and online banking, and lower costs, overtaking New York as the center of finance and insurance jobs, according to the report. These shifts reflect a move away from traditional trading and securities roles in New York, driven by technology and the rise of remote banking, as well as the expansion of industries like insurance and consumer lending. Despite efforts by New York to maintain its status as a global financial capital, the city's lead is being challenged by smaller US cities and potential competitors abroad."

Iaone predominantly played as a number eight or blindside flanker in New Zealand but has started two Premiership games this season at openside for Sale.
""It's a new role for me, I don't really play seven,"" he told BBC Sport.
""From where I'm from I usually play six or eight because sevens back home are a lot fitter than what I am.
""For myself I guess I could add another string to my bow saying I can cover seven now.""
Ioane, who played for the Highlanders in Super Rugby, was given some time off before the start of the season after he played twice in the Rugby World Cup for Samoa.

validation-58,13.823,49,3.54,9.131,Perhaps the playwright Samuel Beckett was a secret economist.,"Summarize in one sentence:
We are about to enjoy (!) the next act in the absurdist drama ""Waiting for the Fed"" (to raise interest rates again).
Truth be told, we can be fairly sure how this scene will play out.  Once again no increase in rates.  Perhaps Godot will turn up first.
The Fed is holding a policy making meeting and an interest rate rise is in theory at least on the agenda.
Janet Yellen, the Fed Chair, and her colleagues would like to get rates back to more normal levels. The Fed currently aims to keep its main policy rate (the rates banks offer to lend to each other overnight) within a range of 0.25% to 0.5%.
They raised it to that level in December last year, from practically zero where it had been since the depth of the financial crisis.
But nobody expects they will hike rates at this meeting, largely because of the very weak performance of the jobs market in May.
The number in employment rose by only 38,000, the fewest since September 2010. Because the US population is growing, the number of people with jobs has to rise by more than that just to keep pace. Employment growth in April was better, but still not all that strong.
It's true that the unemployment rate fell markedly in May, to 4.7% from 5%. But this was due to a decline in the number of people looking for work. They are counted as ""not in the labour force"" rather than unemployed, even if they would like to have a job.
In a recent speech, Ms Yellen described the May jobs report as disappointing and concerning. She did, however, manage to find one encouraging thing; a faster increase in average hourly earnings. After a long period in which the economic recovery has failed to have much of a favourable impact on pay it was, she said, ""a welcome indication that wage growth may finally be picking up"".
Inflation is another factor that encourages the Fed to feel it has no need to rush the next rate rise.  The latest figure for the inflation measure the Fed prefers was 1.1% in April, compared with its 2% target.
That it is so low reflects some transitory factors, including the strength of the dollar (which makes imported goods cheaper) and the decline in energy prices over the last two years. But in time, those factors cease to have a direct impact, so Ms Yellen expects inflation to move back towards 2%.
She also said that it's important not to attach too much significance to a single monthly jobs report. In short, a good report next month could bring interest rate rises a lot closer.
So while investors think the date of the next rate increase has gone further into the future as a result of the May jobs data, the Fed is always ready to change its plans if new figures change the picture.
Looking at the US economy from a longer term perspective, it is a remarkable state of affairs that we should have rates still so close to record lows in a recovery that has been underway for several years.
The US economy started to grow again in the second half of 2009. Since then it has expanded in 25 out of 27 quarters. The production of goods and services, GDP, is 10% higher than the pre-recession peak, and it's 15% up from the low it reached during the downturn.
There has, however, been a slowdown in the growth of productivity in the US, which pre-dates the recession.
The labour market has also gained strength despite May's disappointment. The unemployment rate is now 4.7%, compared to 10% in October 2009. The number of people with jobs has increased by 14 million from its low point in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
But the US has not managed to get back to pre-crisis levels for the percentage of the working age population with jobs.  The latest figure is just below 59%. In 2006 it was more than 63%.
Some of the decline is due to long term factors. The US population is ageing; many of the baby boomer generation are retiring.  More young people are taking post-secondary education.
The recession and its lingering after effects also had an impact. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US publishes figures on the number of people who want to work but haven't looked in the last four weeks, and for people working part-time who would like longer hours.
This group, plus those who are officially classified as unemployed, add up to what is sometimes called ""slack in the labour market""; people who want to work but aren't.
The numbers have declined markedly over the last few years, although one of the concerning things about the May report was a reversal on one aspect; there were more people wanting longer hours.
Nonetheless Ms Yellen said in her recent speech: ""I believe we are now close to eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labour market since the recession"".
The US economy has come a long way from the panic of late 2008. The Fed's interest rate policy has started the journey back to normality. But it will be very slow. And the US can't be considered immune to turbulence that might hit the global economy.","The US Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting, due to weak job market growth and low inflation, with the possibility of a future hike depending on future data, as the economy continues its slow recovery from the financial crisis."
validation-59,18.880,65,3.44,9.039,"For many, Claudio Bravo's first five months in English football were neatly summed up by the caller to the BBC's 606 phone-in last weekend who dubbed the Manchester City goalkeeper a 'false no. 1'.","Summarize in one sentence:
The 33-year-old Chile international arrived with a reputation for fancy footwork but is now, to some, thought of as being a shot-stopper who does not stop shots - something Everton took full advantage of when they scored with every effort they had on target in Sunday's 4-0 win.
City's defence admittedly did not do much to help him at Goodison Park, but Bravo has now conceded a total of 23 goals from the 57 shots on target he has faced in the Premier League this season.
""It looks like people are playing City and thinking if they hit the target, they will score,"" MOTD2 pundit Phil Neville said in his analysis after watching Bravo's latest less than convincing performance.
""It is not even as if they are all going into the corners of the net - he is being beaten in the central areas of his goal too.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
Do the stats back up that belief Bravo should have done better? According to Tom Worville, a data scientist at football analysts Opta, the answer is a resounding yes.
Using an historical database built using information such as the build-up, distance, angle and placement of more than 250,000 shots, Opta can evaluate 'Expected Goals' - the quality of any chance a player has, and how likely it is to be saved.
Or, in Bravo's case, whether it should have been...
Based on the historic quality of those 57 shots on target against City, only 16 should have beaten Bravo, not 23.
The £15.4m summer signing from Barcelona has conceded 6.7 goals more than he should have done, putting him in the bottom five of the 23 Premier League keepers to have faced more than 100 shots in 2016-17.
It gets worse for Bravo when Opta focus on his current eight-game run that has seen him concede 14 goals from 22 shots on target.
""Of those 22 shots, we get an 'Expected Goals' figure of 7.33 - so he has conceded nearly double than expected in that time,"" added Worville. ""It's a huge deficit, and the figures are pretty damning.
""I'm hesitant to jump to the conclusion that Bravo is a poor goalkeeper - we know that he isn't - but he's having a terrible time at the moment.""
Most keepers are having a better time right now, including all of Bravo's counterparts at other top-six clubs.
It is a 12-goal swing from Bravo's figures to those of Burnley's Tom Heaton, the Premier League's top performer by Opta's calculations.
Heaton has saved almost five 'expected' goals this season - enough to give him the edge over the likes of Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Arsenal's Petr Cech, who average around three apiece.
David de Gea has 'saved' one goal for Manchester United while Liverpool's Simon Mignolet has conceded one more than expected. All of them are doing much better than Bravo, though.
Few City fans thought that allowing Joe Hart to leave for a season in Serie A was a good idea back in August. It is possible only Pep Guardiola thinks that is the case now.
Over in Italy, Hart has had a positive effect to the Torino backline, despite conceding the same amount of goals and playing the same number of minutes as Bravo at City.
Bravo has delivered in one area for City, however, and it is the main reason they signed him in the first place.
His passing accuracy in his 18 Premier League games so far is 71.5%, ranked second only to Lloris. That might provide some solace to Guardiola, although even he would probably prefer it if his keeper started making some saves.
""Considering Joe Hart has conceded about one goal fewer than expected, it's easy to jump to the conclusion that with him between the sticks, City may have conceded fewer this season,"" Worville explained.
""Hart's playing behind a different defence though, which definitely has an impact on the quality of shots that he's facing.
""Additionally there's a lot more to goalkeeping than making stops, with the distribution side of things being one of the main reasons Bravo was bought back in the summer.
""Having Hart in the team may have lead to fewer goals conceded, but at the same time it may have impacted the style of play Pep wanted to implement.""","Data analysis suggests Manchester City goalkeeper Claudio Bravo has been outperformed by opponents in the Premier League this season, conceding 23 goals from 57 shots on target, according to Opta's Expected Goals model, highlighting a significant gap compared to top-performing keepers like Burnley's Tom Heaton."

National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidance urges medics to consider sepsis early on when treating any patients unwell with infections.
The problem, caused when the body's immune system overreacts to infection, leads to 44,000 UK deaths a year.
But experts estimate between 5,000 and 13,000 could be avoided.
Sepsis can lead to severe organ failure, shock and death if not treated early enough.
But initial symptoms - such as a rapid breathing or feeling generally unwell - can be vague, making it difficult to set apart from other conditions.
In its first guidance on the issue, NICE acknowledges it is a complex medical problem.
But the health watchdog says GPs, paramedics and hospital staff must make ""Could this be sepsis?"" the first consideration for anyone unwell with an infection - in much the same way that medics consider the possibility of a heart attack for patients with chest pain.
Prof Mark Baker, from NICE, told the BBC: ""The problem with those patients who died unnecessarily of sepsis is that staff did not think about it soon enough.""
He added: ""This is complicated medicine.
""It requires a depth of thought and experience and a way of examining patients which isn't always there - particularly because of time pressures and partly because we have got used to implementing guidelines without thinking.""
Cornwall mother Melissa Mead, whose one-year-old son William died from sepsis in 2014 after potential signs of the condition were missed by NHS 111 staff and GPs, welcomed the move.
She added: ""This could not come any sooner. Sadly we have been touched in very real terms by sepsis and could not agree more that clinicians need to start asking: 'Could this be sepsis?'""
Sepsis happens when the body's immune system - the way the body responds to bugs and germs - goes into overdrive.
The initial problem can be quite mild and start anywhere - from a cut on the finger to a chest or urine infection, for example.
But when the immune system overreacts, this can lead to an unintended but catastrophic attack on the body.
If left untreated, this sets off a cascade of reactions - from shock to organ failure and even death.
There is a lot of research going on to attempt to find out what exactly triggers this sometimes fatal reaction.
Read more: Why can sepsis be so hard to spot?
Meanwhile, Dr Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ""The diagnosis of sepsis is a huge worry for GPs, as initial symptoms can be similar to common viral illnesses, so we welcome any guidance or support to help us identify it as early as possible.""
The guidelines say patients with possible sepsis should be sent to hospital in an ambulance and treated urgently by senior staff.
Separately, NHS Improvement has launched an initiative to tackle children's health.
It encourages parents to speak up if their child's health is deteriorating and urges staff to work more closely with parents.

""There have been far too many cases covered in the media on the failure to treat sepsis that have highlighted the sad and frustrating instances of parents repeatedly flagging concerns about their children.""","The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued guidance urging healthcare professionals to prioritize sepsis detection in unwell patients with infections, estimating that between 5,000 and 13,000 UK deaths from the condition annually could be prevented by early recognition, as it can lead to severe organ failure and death if not treated promptly, despite often having vague symptoms."

Among the gripes is that bin collections are getting less frequent and cause a smelly pile-up. So what options do parents have?
Nappy bins are not always free - or available - across the UK.
Dorset, for example, recently introduced a £13 charge for an annual supply of nappy sacks, which are available for children up to age three.
Councils in Bournemouth and Poole let households of five people or more buy an extra bin for £43.
Kalpana Fitzpatrick, a journalist from London, thinks the charges are ""absolutely ridiculous"". She tweeted: ""Why not introduce a tax for dog owners where councils have to have poop bins instead of introducing a nappy tax?""
About eight million nappies are thrown away every day in the UK, according to local authorities, with one baby using enough disposable nappies to fill 40 black sacks a year.
Mother-of-three Wendy Richards, who uses reusable cloth nappies, says a nappy bin charge is ""understandable"".
""The average baby goes through a huge amount of nappies,"" she says. ""People don't realise how much landfill waste that is. Someone's got to pay for it.""
Young parents have complained of a ""poo problem"" as the time between bin collections has increased, with some areas in the UK having to wait a whole month.
Abi Jones, a PA from Essex who blogs about being mother to two-year-old Alfie, says her family has ""definitely found it more difficult"" since their local council switched to fortnightly bin collections.
""Had Alfie been a newborn - and getting through the amount of disposals newborns do - we would have had to make extra trips to the local refuse centre,"" she says.
Anglesey council, which has three-weekly collections, offers parents an extra nappy bin collection. But once a toddler reaches age three the service stops, as by this age the council says most children are potty trained.
In Bridgend, the council introduced purple collection bags for nappies and other items, such as incontinence pads, in June after it said smaller households could throw away up to two rubbish bags a fortnight.
Councils say the move from weekly rubbish collections saves money and encourages people to recycle more. Local authorities have a target to recycle at least half of all waste by 2020, to meet the European Union's Waste Framework Directive.
Councils often make exceptions for large families, disabled children and for people with medical conditions if they need more space for waste.
But Carly Dashwood, responding to the charges on Facebook, said they were ""disgusting"" if parents with disabled children had to pay.
She writes: ""I have a disabled child and he is in nappies. This is very unfair on people that don't have a choice in the matter.""
It is not compulsory to use nappy bins or sacks, but councils can fine families if their household waste gets out of control.
If a bin is so full it is deemed littering, councils can issue fixed penalty notices of about £60 to £80 - or slightly less for early payment - under the Environmental Protection Act.
If the offence is classed as fly-tipping, fines are between £150 and £400.
Rubbish collectors might to refuse to empty a bin if it is overflowing.
The number of fines issued for littering - which can include overflowing bins - was more than 140,000 in England and Wales in 2015 to 2016, according to a freedom of information request by civil liberties group, the Manifesto Club.
Reusable nappies are typically made from a cloth, such as bamboo, and a fleecy liner, and go in the washing machine.
Abi, who also uses both types of nappies for Alfie, thinks reusing is cheaper overall but can ""seem like a lot of work"".
""There is extra washing involved - about three loads a week - but this isn't much in the grand scheme of things,"" she says.
""You don't have to use them every day,"" she adds. ""If we're going out I use disposables, as they don't take up as much space.""
But the upfront cost - about £200 for a kit of 20 - can be off-putting.
Wendy says she always wanted to use cloth nappies as ""money was tight"" when she became a full-time mother.
She says: ""I did think - 'oh my goodness, what if I don't use them?' but £300 has lasted me three children.""
Prices of reusable nappies vary from about £7 to £30 per nappy.
According to consumer group Which? a basic set of reusable nappies - £80 - is still cheaper than buying a cheap brand of disposable nappies, at £38 for the first few months.
Some councils give away vouchers for reusable nappies, or free trial kits so parents can try different brands - but the giveaways depend on where you live.
""My council in Hampshire did nothing,"" says Wendy. ""It is frustrating"".
The Real Nappy campaign has a search tool for parents to find out if they can get free nappies from the council.","Parents in the UK complain about increasing nappy bin charges, causing堆积 and smell, with some councils charging for annual nappy sacks or extra bins, leading to calls for alternatives like tax on dog owners or free reusable nappy schemes."

The report indicates nearly a quarter of men and a sixth of women over the age of 55 who think they hear well actually have a hearing loss.
And less than a third of all adults with a hearing loss use a hearing aid.
The charity Action on Hearing Loss said it took most people a decade to seek help.
It is the first time the annual health survey, conducted by NatCen Social Research, has compared people's perceptions about their hearing with the results of actual tests.
Dr Jennifer Mindell, from UCL and one of the authors of the section on hearing, said the findings were worrying.
She told the BBC: ""Whether people are in denial or just unaware of what they can't hear we don't know.""
She said about half of the people who had said they had ""great difficulty"" hearing still did not use a hearing aid.
Dr Mindell said: ""People think it's a normal part of ageing, and some don't want a hearing aid as they feel there's a stigma attached in a way that people don't with glasses.""
Untreated hearing loss can lead to social exclusion due to the restrictive effect on conversation.
Dr Mindell said it was a ""cause for concern"" and there was a link between untreated hearing loss and poor mental health.
The report suggests:
Gemma Twitchen, an audiologist with the charity Action on Hearing Loss, said: ""Reluctance to acknowledge hearing difficulties is far more common than we might think - on average it takes people 10 years to seek help for hearing loss.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of sight loss in the developed world.
Patients are usually treated with ongoing monthly injections directly into their eyes.
Australian and Chinese researchers believe gold nanoparticles could help better deliver drugs to the eye.
Their study, published this week in the chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie, tested how a hydrogel filled with gold nanoparticles reacted when exposed to light.
The researchers found the gel softened and released a dose of sight-restoring drug when it warmed by a only few degrees under the light. The process reversed when the light disappeared, hardening the gel and preventing the drug's delivery.
The biological activity of the protein-based drug was ""highly retained"" after its release, the study said.
Researcher Johan Basuki, from Australia's government-backed CSIRO, hoped the new drug delivery system would let AMD patients have injections less frequently - potentially once every six months.
""The idea is to develop a 'drug reservoir' that can be implanted in the eye and then use visible light to trigger the drug that is embedded in the hydrogel,"" Dr Basuki said.
""To do that we are using gold nanoparticles which have been known as a safe, inert, non-reactive component in the biomedical field.""
Nanoparticles, typically 1000 times thinner than a human hair, are too small to see with a microscope.
The preliminary safety tests were conducted on rabbits, but further research is needed before human trials will be considered.
The joint project between CSIRO and independent Chinese researchers is seeking investors to take research to the next stage.
""In order to understand the function in the human body, I think we need to do a long-term study,"" Dr Basuki said.
""The beauty of this versatile system is that the components are already FDA-approved, so they are safe for clinical use.""
Researchers are also investigating possible uses for the technology in agriculture, to fight cancer, and for use in personal care.","Australian and Chinese researchers have developed a hydrogel-filled with gold nanoparticles that softens and releases a sight-restoring drug in response to light, potentially reducing the frequency of monthly injections for age-related macular degeneration patients, and the technology has potential applications beyond eye treatment."

Prabir Mukherjee was the curator at Eden Gardens, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). India were playing England and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni had suggested a spinning track be prepared for the Test match.
Pitch preparation is not an exact science; in the past, ""spinning"" tracks have been prepared where the seamers have run through the Indian batting, while ""flat"" tracks have been prepared where the fast bowlers have wreaked havoc.
The Indian curator's favourite technique for a spinning track is to leave it underprepared.
Spin has been India's strength for so long that it is a cliche now.
Yet visiting spinners have often been more successful than India's best - from Richie Benaud and Ashley Mallett to Lance Gibbs and Derek Underwood, and more recently, Monty Panesar and Graeme Swann.
It is neither illegal nor unethical to prepare a wicket to suit the home team's bowlers. It would be foolish to do otherwise.
If Jim Laker could claim 19 wickets on a dry Old Trafford wicket nearly half a century ago, part of the credit should go to his captain Peter May, who persuaded the groundsman into not watering the pitch in advance.  Was that unethical? Or illegal?
The illegal and the unethical co-exist in sport. On the cricket field, it is illegal to overstep when bowling - umpires call a 'no ball' immediately - but it isn't unethical.
It is unethical to claim a catch when you know that the ball has hit the ground, but it isn't illegal.
No-one minds a three-day Test as long as the battle between bat and ball is fascinating.
The curator is subject to a set of opposing demands. A quick win for the home side versus a full five-day match which is what television demands. The latter are often boring run feasts. The toss can ruin the best-laid plans of curators.
Had South Africa made in the first innings the same score they did in the second, Nagpur might have had a different story to tell in the ongoing series against India. South Africa made more in the fourth innings than India did in the third.
The tracks at Mohali and Nagpur for the current series have not been minefields or square turners.
True, they aided spin early, but they were the allies of batsman willing to stay and play. That 40 was the highest score in four innings at Nagpur was not so much an indictment of the pitch as of the batsmen's technique.
No-one expects tracks in seamer-friendly England to be like the pace-friendly ones in Australia or South Africa. Cricket's - in fact, any sport's - charm lies in the variety and range of its settings. Conditions change, challenges differ. Overcoming the opposition by conquering the conditions is the essence of the game.
Uniformity - of pitches, grounds, weather - is neither possible nor desirable.
The South Africans have had to deal with difficult pitches, not impossible ones.
Batting techniques have been tested, and not just those of the visitors. Indians, who presumably ought to be happier in home conditions have displayed the same lack of technique. The shorter formats have formalised the habit of hitting your way out of trouble. Test cricket demands greater discipline and more respect for the essentials of batsmanship.
When Indian leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani claimed 16 wickets in his debut Test in Chennai, the visiting captain, Viv Richards of the West Indies told the Indian team: ""Come home, we'll show you,"" he said.
The message holds good in all sport: home rules apply.

Rising energy prices pushed inflation to 1.8% in January, a near four-year high and up from 1.1% in December.
Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009.
GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter.
The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before.
The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%.
Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme.
However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January.
In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended.
The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending.
The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain ""price stability"" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%.
For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices.
That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money.
So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off?
Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow.
There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal.
The eurozone's unemployment rate of 9.6% in December was down from 9.7% in November and  compares with a rate of 10.5% a year earlier.
The countries with the lowest unemployment rates in December were the Czech Republic (3.5%) and Germany (3.9%), while countries with the highest levels of unemployment were Greece (23.0% in October 2016) and Spain (18.4%).
Despite the pick-up in economic growth during the final quarter of 2016, across the year as a whole eurozone GDP rose by 1.7%, which was down from 2% in 2015.
Analysts also questioned whether the recent improvement could be sustained.
""While recent economic news points to improved growth, we suspect the eurozone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight.
""Consequently, we suspect that eurozone GDP growth in 2017 will be no more than 1.6%. We also see growth at 1.6% in 2018.""","Rising energy prices pushed eurozone inflation to a near-four-year high of 1.8% in January, up from 1.1% in December, while the jobless rate fell to 9.6%, its lowest since 2009, and GDP growth rose to 0.5% in Q4 2016, though analysts caution against overestimating the momentum due to political and inflationary pressures."

Mr Adams referred to past and present leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who have led a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland since 2007.
""Ian Paisley can go into government with Martin McGuinness, and Peter Robinson can go into government, and Arlene Foster can go into government with Martin McGuinness,"" Mr Adams said.
The Sinn Féin leader was challenged by one of the debate moderators, Pat Kenny, that the D'Hondt system forces the parties in Northern Ireland together.
The D'Hondt system is a type of proportional representation used to allocate seats and ministerial posts.
Mr Adams said it was the citizens of Northern Ireland make the decisions about who goes into government by them giving a mandate.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny was asked whether the bookmakers' predicted outcome, a Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil coalition, was the most likely outcome.
He replied that voters have a choice between ""the party that wrecked the country, or two parties with different perspectives who have worked together to set the country on the path to recovery"". He said Fine Gael/Labour will provide stability.
When the debate moved to the Irish economy, Labour leader Joan Burton accused Sinn Féin of ""fuzzy economics"" which would kill jobs.
The Irish deputy prime minister said she is mystified by Sinn Féin's plans to cut the Universal Social Charge (USC), claiming it would reduce tax only for people earning less than €20,000 (£15,515).
USC is a tax that was introduced in December 2010 as a temporary measure by the late finance minister, Brian Lenihan.
It was applicable to all gross incomes over €4,004 (£3,106)
Still on the issue of taxation, Mr Kenny said Sinn Féin would impose a 65% marginal tax rate and ""wreck the economy"".
Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin claimed Fine Gael would bring in US-style tax rates and run down public services.
Ms Burton said low and middle income families need to ""see the back of the USC"", which Fianna Fáil brought in.

The Scot had been under pressure in the first year of his own four-year contract with the English Premier League club.
But the win over Hull lifts Sunderland above Swansea City and off the bottom of the table.
Moyes has often said that he would like to manage his country at some point but was unhappy to be linked with the role with Strachan still in post.

""I think Scotland did well against England. I think that the score flattered England a little bit.
""And I think Gordon's working with the tools he's got and deserves to be in the position.""
Scotland's 3-0 defeat by the English at Wembley left the Scots six points behind the Group F leaders and four adrift of second-top Slovenia.
However, Ross County winger Chris Burke, who has seven Scotland caps, thinks Strachan's side can still finish second and secure a play-off place.

The MoD said the partnership could mean more intelligence is shared about the latest cyber threats.
Defence companies face cyber-attacks almost daily, often from countries seeking to steal sensitive information about new technology and weapons.
Officials say they hope the plan will serve as a model for other sectors.
The new Defence Cyber Protection Partnership - a joint effort between the UK government and nine large defence companies - is designed to improve the industry's collective defences against cyber-attacks.
It will also work to establish higher standards of security for smaller companies in the supply chain.
Cyber-attacks are one of the top four threats to UK national security alongside international terrorism, according to the government's National Security Strategy.
Earlier this month, UK intelligence service GCHQ said Britain was seeing about 70 sophisticated cyber-espionage operations a month against government or industry networks - some 15 of which were against the defence industry.
GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban said business secrets were being stolen on an ""industrial scale"" and in some cases foreign hackers had penetrated firms for up to two years.
In 2010 the British government designated the protection of computer networks as one of the country's most important national security priorities.
It pledged Â£650m of new investment over the next four years to continue tackling the problem as part of its National Cyber Security Programme.
In March, the government launched the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership to help businesses and government share information on cyber threats, including a secure web portal to allow information to be shared in real-time.","The UK government has announced a new Defence Cyber Protection Partnership with nine defence companies to enhance collective defences against cyber-attacks and promote security standards for smaller suppliers, following frequent cyber-attacks targeting the sector."
validation-79,23.940,83,3.47,9.848,Chris Froome heads into the Vuelta a Espana looking to create more history by becoming the first British winner of the three-week race.,"Summarize in one sentence:
The four-time Tour de France winner made his breakthrough when finishing second in 2011's race to equal the then-best finish by a British rider in a Grand Tour.
Will he go one better this year and become the third man to complete the Tour-Vuelta double in the same year - and first since the Spanish race was switched from early to late in the season 22 years ago?
Froome goes into the race as favourite but with six of the top 10 from this year's Tour and the likes of five-time Grand Tour winner Vincenzo Nibali and Britain's Adam Yates in the mix, the Vuelta promises to be as tough as they come.
The race starts in Nimes in France on Saturday, 19 August and concludes in Madrid on Sunday, 10 September.
The youngest of the three annual Grand Tours, the Vuelta, like its cousins the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France, is a three-week race made up of 21 stages, raced over 23 days.
Prior to 1995 the race took place earlier in the season but often clashed with other major races so was switched to after May's Giro and July's Tour.
It was first raced in 1935, and aside from pauses for the Spanish Civil War and World War II, it has been contested continuously since 1955.
The 72nd edition of the race is starting outside of Spain for just the third time after Lisbon, Portugal in 1997 and Assen, Netherlands in 2009.
It is often an unpredictable race with riders racing who have suffered injuries or health problems earlier in the season, or those trying to rescue a failed season, while riders like Froome are trying to maintain their form from the Tour de France.
The route is notoriously mountainous, as evidenced by this year's race, which features nine summit finishes.
""It's vicious,"" is Froome's take on it, while 2015 champion Fabio Aru says it will be the ""usual horrendous race"" and the ""toughest stage race of the 2017 season"".
The summit finishes are spread evenly across the three weeks with a mix of short, sharp climbs such as stage five's 3.5km ascent of Ermita Santa Lucia. It features gradients of 20%, while stage 15 finishes at an altitude of 2,510m in Sierra Nevada. The penultimate stage pits the riders against the infamous Alto de Angliru, where Sky lost the 2011 Vuelta when Froome waited for team leader Bradley Wiggins as Juan Jose Cobo launched a race-winning attack.
An opening team time trial in Nimes should not be long enough to create any significant time gaps between those chasing the overall victory but crucial seconds will be won and lost.
Race organisers will hope the 40km individual time trial on stage 16 will help balance out the climbs but it could just serve to strengthen Froome's grip on the title.
Sprinter-friendly stages are few, although those that make it to the finale are rewarded with a chance of glory in Madrid.
In a nutshell, he can climb with the best in the race and is a better time-trial rider. He has finished runner-up on three occasions and goes into the race saying he has ""unfinished business"".
The 32-year-old also has arguably the strongest nine-man squad to help keep him out of trouble on flatter stages and set the pace on the tougher ascents. And, given his excellent form in the third and final week of July's Tour de France, Froome appears to have tailored his season to perfection, allowing him to also peak for the Vuelta.
On the eve of the race, he said: ""The plan was to have a lighter first part of the season and I think that's worked. I certainly feel fresher. But whether that's reflected in the racing we'll have to wait and see.""
Froome's rivals know they need to attack on ascents and descents in the mountains in the hope of picking up enough seconds to neutralise the time they will expect to lose in the 40km individual time trial.
And that stage 16 is one that Froome has earmarked. ""The time trial is one day I'm looking forward to, a lot of time can be won or lost there,"" he said. ""And of course stage 20 to the Angliru is a massive stage.""
Romain Bardet - the AG2R La Mondiale rider was the big hope for a first French Tour winner since 1985 in July, but he knows he needs to up his time trialling skills if he is to finally win a Grand Tour.
He lost almost two minutes to Froome over a 22km course in Marseille in July. Bardet, who is riding in his first Vuelta, said: ""My ambitions will be different than in the Tour de France but surrounded by a strong team, I hope to make an impact on stages that suit me.""
Fabio Aru - the Italian won this race in 2015 and will love the steep climbs. However, he too lost significant time to Froome in the Tour's time trial and is wary of the Vuelta's team test on day one. He said: ""I think I've recovered well after the Tour and have a good team with me.
We've got to limit the damage in the opening team time trail and be ready for the wind on Sunday. The nine uphill finishes means we'll be flat out all the time. It'll be good to watch, with time gaps each time.""
Vincenzo Nibali - the Italian is one of six riders to have won all three Grand Tours and will be relatively fresh having missed the Tour after finishing third in the Giro.
Froome has picked out the Bahrain-Merida rider as his main threat. However, his team is not as strong as Sky's and he too will need to attack in the mountains because he is an inferior time trialler. He said: ""I'm feeling pretty good. We'll find out how good along the road, day by day. I did a good block of training in the Dolomites that gave me the answers [about my form] that I was looking for.""
Alberto Contador - the 34-year-old winner of eight Grand Tours is calling time on his career after the Vuelta but insists it won't be a lap of honour round his home country.
The three-time Vuelta winner said: ""I have always given my maximum as a rider and I will do that now. This Vuelta is special, and I want to enjoy it. I feel lucky that I can be here, it's a really good place to say goodbye. So I want to see how the legs are feeling, see what kind of form my rivals have, but I have come with the idea of fighting to win and to enjoy it, too.""
Aside from Froome, the Yates twins Adam and Simon provide the biggest hope of a podium finish for a British rider. The Orica-Scott pair are racing together in a Grand Tour for the first time since since the 2015 Tour de France and are part of a three-pronged attack for the Australian-based team.
Adam finished ninth at the Giro d'Italia in May and has a best Grand Tour finish of fourth at last year's Tour de France, when he also became the first Briton to win the young rider classification. Simon won that category in this year's race, finishing seventh overall, his best in a three-week race.
Both are competing in a second Grand Tour in the same year for the first time but Adam is buoyant about their chances, particularly because they also have renowned climber Esteban Chaves in their squad.
""If we can get on the podium, that'd be great, whether it's me, or Simon or Esteban,"" he told Cycling News.
""Esteban is another card we can play, especially in the third week. How many teams have three guys that can potentially be top 10, or even, depending on how much everybody else is going, top five?""
Simon is hopeful his body will ""react in a positive way"" after ""keeping things ticking over"" since finishing the Tour in July.
""We'll know in the early tough stages how I'm going,"" he added. ""It depends on how my legs are. But as a team, either way, we're going to do quite well.""
Ian Stannard is the only other Briton in Team Sky's squad and he will be tasked with helping keep Froome safe and in contention on the flatter sections.
The two other Britons in the race both ride for Irish team Aqua Blue Sport. Adam Blythe, the 2016 national road race champion will be looking to win sprint stages, while Mark Christian, who was seventh in the Tour de Yorkshire, is taking on his first Grand Tour.
No rider has won all three Grand Tours in the same year, although Belgian legend Eddy Merckx did win four on the trot, the last two in 1972 and the first two in 1973.
Only Frenchmen Bernard Hinault (1978) and Jacques Anquetil (1963) have won the Vuelta and Tour in the same year and they achieved that at a time when the Spanish race preceded the French one.
In 1995 the Vuelta was switched to post-Tour and since then only four riders have finished in the top three in both races in the same year. Froome came closest to completing the double last year when he won the Tour and finished runner-up in the Vuelta.
The Giro-Tour double has been achieved most often, with Merckx doing it three of the 12 times, while the Giro-Vuelta double has been done three times.
Merckx (1973) and Italy's Giovanni Battaglin (1981) remarkably won both when they were raced with just a few days separating each Tour. Spain's Alberto Contador (2008) is the only victorious rider since the Vuelta was moved to late summer.

validation-81,14.849,74,4.98,9.236,"From unattainable house prices to disappointing pay rises, the financial challenges faced by young adults can seem daunting.","Summarize in one sentence:
How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.
It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.
This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.
Then we had the financial crisis of 2008.
The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.
For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.
The figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.
Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.
By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.
By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.
A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.
At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.
Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.
Similarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.
The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.
In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.
At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.
For today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.
Lower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.
Of course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.
The vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.
This is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.
The schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.
In their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.
This compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.
In 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.
With stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.
But those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.
Of those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.
This figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.
Our data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.
Within each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.
Among the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.
This compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.
Data is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.
So, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.
But most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.
It looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.

A Â£26,000 grant has been promised to the council to draw up plans to improve the Lord's Garden in Ruthin.
Denbighshire council says 100 people who braved snow and ice to attend an open day at the weekend is testament to the local support for restoration.
The authority now has to learn more about the site's history and plan for its future to win the necessary cash.
Wendy Williams, of the Lord's Garden Restoration Project, said: ""The bid will need to be a balancing act between staying faithful to the tremendous amount of natural and political history in the gardens, and making that history accessible to a modern audience.
""The gardens have been virtually untouched for decades, and whilst they're a beautiful wilderness, at the moment you have to be an expert to interpret the wonderful sights and sounds.
""We'd like to work with local people to try and find new and sympathetic ways of bringing that history alive again.""
The Lord's Garden is now part of Nantclwyd y Dre in Ruthin, which is thought may be Wales' oldest timber-framed town house.
Although the Grade II-listed gardens, originally known as The Lord's Acre, pre-date even this structure.
They are first mentioned in 1282 as having been awarded to Marcher Lord Reginald de Grey along with Ruthin Castle, in recognition of the part he played in subduing an uprising by Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, the last native prince of an independent Wales.
The Lord's Acre appears to have remained an orchard and kitchen garden to the castle's occupants for around 350 years, and many of the fruit trees there date from between 1300 and 1600.
By the time of the English Civil War in the 1640s, the Lord's Acre passed to the Nantclwyd y Dre estate, and the focus seems to have shifted more towards meadowland and ornamental gardens.
Next month archaeologists are planning a dig at the site to try and throw more light on the role the area played in the Civil War.
But before that, the heritage service wants to give local people the opportunity to see the gardens in their untouched beauty.
""Until now we've been unable to open up the gardens, but as part of the public consultation into the proposed restoration, we're throwing open the gates for the first time,"" said Ms Williams.
""We'd love to hear from local historians and amateur detectives about what they've been able to unearth about the history, and we welcome any ideas about how we can make the gardens a valuable learning resource.
""But it doesn't matter if all you want to do is come along and have a look, because they really are a hidden treasure which we'd love as many people as possible to see.""","A £26,000 grant has been awarded to Denbighshire council to develop plans for restoring the Lord's Garden in Ruthin, following a successful open day that attracted 100 attendees despite snowy conditions, with the aim of preserving the site's historical significance while making it accessible to the public."

But make no mistake - these are crucial, perhaps even momentous, times for South African politics.
A status quo that has survived for 20 years of democracy is finally beginning to crack.
There is a chance this could be a good thing for South Africa - that a clumsy consensus that served the country well in the years after apartheid is no longer fit for purpose, and that a more nuanced, contested form of democracy may now take over.
But the governing African National Congress (ANC) does not see it like that, warning loudly that ""fascists"" and ""racists"" are threatening the survival of the institutions that have kept this country stable since 1994.
Much now depends on the way the ANC - after two decades of unchallenged power - deals with a more robust opposition in parliament, the erosion of a key political alliance with the trade union movement, and the dawning possibility that it may soon lose power in two of South Africa's nine provinces - and one day at a national level too.
Thursday's fighting in parliament can be traced directly to two immediate factors - one is the recent influx of MPs from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party.
They are unapologetically rowdy and populist, and have energised - not always in a constructive way - an institution that many South Africans, numbed by the ANC's overwhelming majority, had apparently stopped caring about.
The second factor is called Nkandla - the scandal about the lavish tax-payer-funded renovations to President Jacob Zuma's private home that will not disappear.
Although many senior ANC figures have privately expressed deep unease about the issue, the party has publically rallied around the president in strident fashion.
The last straw - well, one of many - came in the shape of an ad-hoc parliamentary committee that exonerated Mr Zuma of any personal wrongdoing, after opposition members had left it in frustration.
The ANC then used its majority to adopt the committee's report on Thursday.
South Africa's opposition is usually divided in parliament - and outside - to the advantage of the ANC.
But Nkandla has seen political rivals united against the governing party with unusual vigour and co-ordination.
It could be a sign of things to come - an opposition coalition one day strong enough to challenge the ANC's majority.
All of which helps explain why the current chaos in South Africa's trade union movement is also giving the ANC real cause for concern.
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has been in a strategic tri-partite alliance with the ANC and Communist Party - an arrangement that helped keep stability and achieve some progress in the labour market for decades.
But a combination of factors - including falling membership, political rivalries, and incidents like the Marikana mine killings of 2012 - have led to a deep split, with the biggest trade union, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa), now expelled from Cosatu.
A more competitive, vibrant trade union movement - decoupled from its leaders' increasingly cosy pact with government - may not necessarily be a bad thing for South Africa, at a time when the economy is struggling and business, government and labour urgently need to re-evaluate their relationships.
But again, the ANC is unlikely to react enthusiastically.
It has only to glance north, towards Zimbabwe, to see the potential challenge that a well-organised, union-based party can offer to a seemingly robust liberation movement.
Zimbabwe's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has not ultimately triumphed in the way many predicted, but that may have as much to do with rigged elections and violence as with its own internal flaws.
The likelihood of a new trade union party sweeping to power in South Africa is vastly overstated.
This country already has a crowded opposition scene.
But it would certainly take more votes away from the ANC and push the governing party closer towards electoral defeat.
In other words, these are increasingly challenging times for South Africa's ANC.
Will it tackle corruption, improve service delivery, harness its prodigious talents, and earn the right to many more years in power?
Or will it scream ""fascists"" at every new challenge, ignore court orders, and - as some already fear - start to chip away at the impartiality of the independent electoral system that has served this democracy so well?","South African politics is undergoing a significant shift as the ruling African National Congress (ANC) faces challenges from an energetic EFF opposition, a eroding political alliance with trade unions, and a scandal involving President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla residence, potentially leading to a more competitive opposition and a more nuanced democracy, but the ANC, fearing losing power, reacts defensively and risks alienating voters."

She never quite got Scotland.  However, Margaret Thatcher is not alone among Westminster leaders in that regard.
For the most part, she was adored by her party in Scotland, just as in England.
But, even as they worshipped, quite a few Scottish Tories fretted that her politics would prove particularly divisive north of the border and thus electorally unpopular.

""Today, however, the proper reaction should be respect and condolences to her family.""
Ms Davidson praised Lady Thatcher's policies, including extending the right for people to buy their council house.
Ruth Davidson said: ""She defended Britain's sovereignty, helped win the cold war, empowered thousands to own their own home by democratising property ownership and smashed the glass ceiling.
""My thoughts are with her family.""
Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: ""I came into politics to fight the ideology and values of Margaret Thatcher which I believe damaged our country. But today is not a day to debate that.
""Today is a day to offer the deepest condolences to her family, friends and all who loved her.
""No-one can deny she made a deep mark on the history of this country.""
Under Baroness Thatcher's leadership the Conservative government implemented social and economic policies which were unpopular in Scotland, including the Community Charge or poll tax.
The introduction of the poll tax, which took place in Scotland in 1989 - 12 months before the rest of the UK, led to widespread protests and a lasting animosity towards the Conservative party in Scotland.
Sir Malcolm Rifkind, served as Secretary of State for Scotland in her cabinet, said many of her major achievements also continued to be reflected in public opinion.
He told BBC Scotland: ""In a sense what made her so magnificent is occasionally what made her a very difficult and controversial character because she had very strong views, she put them forward uncompromisingly.
""She didn't mind being challenged, indeed she would listen with great care if she thought the person challenging her actually knew what they were talking about and she could change her mind and opinions, but only on the basis of solid evidence and solid argument.
""She would not be influenced by the fact it would be unpopular. That she despised, as well as disapproved of.""
Baroness Thatcher's economic policy was also praised by Iain McMillan, director of CBI Scotland. He said: ""It is all too easy to overlook the dreadful state that the UK economy was in at that time and the challenges that she and her government faced.
""Through sheer tenacity and immense courage, Margaret Thatcher changed the UK economy for the better and laid the ground for years of greatly improved economic performance.""
The former chief political correspondent of the BBC, John Sergeant said: ""It's interesting that her two election campaigns that really mattered were 1979 and '83 - both of them started in Perth. That's where she made her opening speech.
""So Scotland did matter to her a great deal, but she was always rather dismayed that she didn't do very well in Scotland.
""Her heart used to sink travelling north, as it did for Tony Blair. Once the poll tax was hung round her neck, and of course the miners dispute and everything else, she was always an amazingly divisive figure in Scotland and Tory fortunes north of the border never recovered from that early period.""","Baroness Thatcher, a divisive political figure in Scotland despite her strong bond with the country, is mourned by political leaders who recognize her significant impact on British history, including Scottish Conservatives, Labour leader Johann Lamont, and CBI Scotland's Iain McMillan, while acknowledging her controversial policies like the poll tax."

It said the ""damning"" information on the new driver-only-operated (DOO) services came from passengers and rail workers.
Southern said industrial action and a drivers' overtime ban had displaced its on-board supervisors ""on occasions"".
A 24-hour walkout by RMT conductors on the Southern network over changes to their roles is under way.
Southern is replacing conductors with on-board supervisors (OBS) who would no longer be in charge of closing train doors.
The company has said the changes it is making are ""small"" and ""safe"".
But the RMT believes public safety is at risk.  It also says a second member of staff on trains is critical.
The union said that, in previous correspondence to MPs, Southern anticipated 0.06% of trains would run without an OBS, the equivalent to one service, every two days.
But the RMT said information provided for five days - 9, 12, 14, 15 and 18 January - suggested 15 trains travelled without one. It said this was at least six times more trains than promised.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said the union believed the instances of trains running without a second person were ""far more widespread and will rapidly and substantially increase"".
A Southern spokesperson said: ""Last-minute changes to some services caused by the industrial action and the drivers' overtime ban has displaced the on-board supervisor so that, on occasions, they've not been able to join the train.
""Previously, this train would have had to be cancelled but we can now run the service and avoid disrupting hundreds of passengers.""","Passengers and rail workers have provided ""damning"" information about Southern Railway's new driver-only-operated services, revealing that 15 trains traveled without a second staff member, six times more than initially anticipated during a 24-hour RMT conductor strike, raising concerns about public safety, according to the union."

The pro-Rouhani reformist group Omid (Hope) won all 21 seats, ousting their conservative rivals who had been in power for 14 years.
Mr Rouhani won Friday's presidential election in the first round.
He promised voters a moderate and outward-looking Iran and criticised the conservative-dominated judiciary.
Council elections were held alongside the presidential vote and the results were announced on Sunday.
The new city council must convene within 45 days when it will elect a new mayor to oversee services for Tehran's nine million residents.
Incumbent Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf was a candidate in the early stages of the presidential election but dropped out to back hardliner Ebrahim Raisi.
Mr Raisi only received 38.5% of the vote, which was not enough to take the election to a second round.
President Rouhani, 68, said his resounding victory showed that voters rejected extremism and wanted more links with the outside world.
Analysts say he is in a strong position to seek reforms and to revive Iran's ailing economy.
After his re-election there were celebrations in the capital, Tehran, with crowds of young people singing and dancing in the central Vali Asr Square.
In his first speech after the result was announced Mr Rouhani said: ""The Iranian nation has chosen the path of interaction with the world, a path which is distant from extremism and violence.""

The Houthi delegation, which was due to arrive on Sunday, was still in Djibouti in east Africa on Monday evening.
Mr Ban warned that ""while the parties bicker, Yemen burns"" and urged an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
An estimated 20 million Yemenis are in need of aid following months of fighting in the country.
The humanitarian situation has been described as ""catastrophic"" by the UN, with more than 2,000 people killed in the conflict.
Opening the talks, Mr Ban said: ""Today Yemen's very existence hangs in the balance.""
He urged action on three main areas: ""First, a renewed humanitarian pause to allow critical assistance to reach all Yemenis in need and provide a respite for Yemenis as the holy month of Ramadan begins.
""Second, I urge the parties to reach agreement on local ceasefires. Third, I call on them to resume a peaceful and orderly political transition and to ensure that the process includes more representation from other political parties, women, youth and civil society.""
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva said the Houthi representatives were apparently delayed over what airspace their plane could fly through. She said that the confusion did not bode well for the talks.
A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states has been bombing the Houthi rebels and their allies since March.
The bombing campaign was launched to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who escaped to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, when the Houthis advanced on his stronghold in Aden in southern Yemen.
In recent weeks, fighting between Saudi forces and the Houthis has intensified on Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia.
On Saturday, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a Scud missile fired by the Houthis.
The attack followed fighting on the border on Friday, in which four Saudi soldiers and a number of Yemeni rebels died.
On the same day, bombs hit the Old City of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, killing five people according to local sources.","The Houthi delegation's arrival in Djibouti for peace talks has been delayed due to aviation issues, raising concerns about the prospects for negotiations as the humanitarian crisis in Yemen worsens, with over 20 million people in need of aid and fighting continuing between a Saudi-led coalition and the rebels."

City of Glasgow College student Majid Ali was recently held at Dungavel Detention Centre in Lanarkshire.
Supporters believe he was deported on Tuesday night. The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
Mr Ali had accused the Pakistani authorities of killing his uncle and cousin and abducting his brother.
He first claimed asylum in the UK in 2011 after stating that his brother was the victim of an enforced ""disappearance"" by Pakistani authorities.
More recently, Mr Ali claimed that his family home in the Balochistan province was raided by government forces, and his uncle and cousin were shot and killed.
The volatile province, in the south west of Pakistan, has seen conflict between government forces and groups from the region who want more political autonomy or independence and a greater share of revenue from natural resources.
The National Union of Students (NUS) had been running a campaign to keep Mr Ali in the UK.
Earlier this week, NUS Scotland president Gordon Maloney said: ""We are deeply concerned for Majid's safety if he is forced home.
""We all recognise that nobody deserves the kind of treatment he has received in this country, or the grave danger that might await him on his forced return home.""
The campaign had been supported by SNP MP for Glasgow South West, Chris Stephens, who wrote to the immigration minister and Scottish secretary and attempted to raise the case in the House of Commons.

The families of six of the eight men who drafted the original 13 laws of Association Football were tracked down on behalf of the Football Association.
They have travelled from as far away as Washington DC, Chicago and Auckland, as well as Lancashire and London.
The event starts a week of celebrations to mark the FA's 150th birthday.
The FA said little was known about Ebenezer Morley, Arthur Pember, Charles William Alcock, Francis Maule Campbell, John Forster Alcock, Herbert Thomas Steward, George Twizell Wawn and James Turner, who formed the FA in 1863.
Mr Morley, a London solicitor who formed Barnes Football Club in 1862, wrote to popular newspaper Bell's Life suggesting that football should have one set of rules to end disputes about how the game should be played.
He said football should follow the example of cricket, whose rules were set by the Marylebone Cricket Club.
Mr Morley's letter led to the first meeting between the men at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, where the FA was formed on 26 October 1863.
Mr Morley was not represented as his family tree ended upon his death in 1924.
However, 16 relatives of six of the other men were expected to attend following a four-month search led by cultural historian Dr Jane Clayton, of the International Football Institute at the University of Central Lancashire.
It was also discovered that the family tree of Mr Pember crossed with that of another figure of huge historical and cultural significance, Charles Darwin.
In 1925 Mr Pember's great-niece married the evolutionary theorist's grandson, Charles Galton Darwin.
Dr Clayton said: ""For the search to have been so successful is incredibly pleasing as, from a historical perspective, we now know a lot more about a number of the men that created the most popular sport in the world 150 years ago.""
Alex Horne, general secretary of the FA, said: ""In terms of historical significance, the eight founding fathers of football should be placed alongside other great pioneers of this nation.
""The game has become a focal point of the lives of nearly every household in England since it was formed, so to now understand more about the history of these men is incredibly important.""","The families of six of the eight men who established the original rules of Association Football, tracked down by the Football Association, will participate in celebrations marking the organization's 150th anniversary, filling in gaps in knowledge about one of the sport's founders, Ebenezer Morley."

Now, on the surface, these words from Michael Gove shouldn't be surprising. A minister wouldn't advertise disunity.
The surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time.
Insiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view.
Some of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing -  or as some say ""no cliff edge"" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues.
So much for unity. Where do differences still lie?
It was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy.
But for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist.
Liam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years.
As one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter.
But anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a ""disaster"" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period.
Then what form will any transition take?
Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent.
Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit?
The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table.
So while some Remainer ministers I have spoken to this week were upbeat, relaxed and chipper - and believe that British business is making its influence felt - many issues remain unresolved.
And, of course, I use the term 'Remainer"" historically - the cabinet is also united on leaving the EU but the question is how.
There has been talk of soft, hard and clean Brexits. Increasingly another word has entered the lexicon.
David Davis uses it. Michael Gove used it today. Expect to hear more of it. Pragmatic. That's now the goal - a pragmatic Brexit. And that necessarily means compromise at cabinet level as well as with the EU.","UK Minister Michael Gove's comments about an uncertain implementation period after Brexit, surprising given his prominent Leave campaign stance, highlight ongoing divisions within the cabinet over the length and shape of the transition, with some advocating for a swift exit and others wanting a longer, more flexible period, and underscore the need for compromise between Brexit supporters and remainers in negotiations with the EU."

The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations have their spending level dictated by the Barnett formula.
Under it, extra funding or cuts for England has an affect on the other nations, dependent on their population size and the powers devolved to them.
Stormont's finance committee says parts of the formula could be more open.
That could include requiring the Treasury to publish data upon which Barnett-related decisions are based.
As an example, the committee pointed to the initial Treasury decision to classify infrastructure spending on the London Olympics as having UK-wide rather than England-only benefits.
That meant there were was no so-called consequential spending for the devolved governments.
The devolved nations did eventually get extra spending, but only about Â£30m rather than the Â£330m they thought they were due.
Some expert witnesses suggested that an independent body, such as the Office for Budget Responsibility, should be given an oversight role.
Prof Gerry Holtham, who produced a report on funding and financing in Wales, told the committee that Northern Ireland would benefit from the formula ""being put on a proper statutory basis with an element of independence from Treasury introduced"".
The committee also said that the executive should take ""pre-emptive measures"" for the event that the government decides to dispense with or alter the Barnett formula.
It said this could include piloting a new needs-based formula and developing a ""fully considered position"" on what arrangements will be in Northern Ireland's best interests.","The Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish governments' spending is influenced by the Barnett formula, which affects England based on population and devolved powers, but the Stormont finance committee recommends revising it to ensure transparency and consider alternative funding models."

US President Donald Trump has also targeted the programme, tweeting in December that it was ""out of control."" He claimed that negotiations would lead to billions in savings.

But chief financial officer Bruce Tanner said on a call with analysts that nothing significant had changed to the programme in the last six months, though talk about F-35 costs was ""bundled"" with pricing for some of the firm's other contracts.
Chief executive Marillyn Hewson said Lockheed profits took a hit this quarter on a defence programme for an international customer.
Lockheed also reduced the value of a joint venture in the Middle East, which is not seeing as much demand as expected.
But she said a ""volatile"" international environment suggests that military spending may increase, including in the US.
Lockheed sales in the first quarter were up 6.6%, to $11.1bn, from the same period in 2016.

The final score at Ainslie Park, at 22:00 on Wednesday, was 774-707.
The match started on Saturday at 13:00.
The previous record was 102 hours.
Craig Gowans was killed when training equipment he was carrying connected with an overhead power cable at the Little Kerse ground in Grangemouth.
The Craig Gowans Memorial Fund for The Sick Kids Friends Foundation has so far raised almost Â£80,000.
The match was played using seven substitutes on each side. There were no limits on how many times a substitute was used.
Every 12 hours a player clocked up on the pitch gave them one hour off from the match to have a shower or get food.
Eoghan Molloy, a member of the Craig Gowans Memorial Fund organising committee, said: ""The whole experience has been an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.
""There were a lot of mixed emotions as the final whistle blew - from relief and tiredness to joy, happiness and everything in between. It was amazing to hear that final whistle and to finish what we set to achieve.
""I'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of the supporters and volunteers who came down to support us across the four days.

The money raised will be used to fund enhancements to the new Sick Kids hospital at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh at Little France, specifically a state-of-the-art Snoezelen room in Craig's name.
The space will be a calming room with multi-sensory equipment providing a relaxing and stimulating space for children with sensory impairments.
