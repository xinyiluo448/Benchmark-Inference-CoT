If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?","Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of the appetizer:
   $$ \text{Appetizer} = \$10 $$

2. Calculate the cost of the 4 entrees:
   Each entree costs $20, so for 4:
   $$ \text{Entrees} = 4 \times \$20 = \$80 $$

3. Add the cost of the appetizer and the entrees to get the total before tip:
   $$ \text{Total Before Tip} = \text{Appetizer} + \text{Entrees} = \$10 + \$80 = \$90 $$

4. Calculate the tip based on 20% of the total:
   $$ \text{Tip} = 20\% \times \text{Total Before Tip} = 20\% \times \$90 = 0.20 \times \$90 = \$18 $$

5. Add the tip to the total before tip to find the final amount spent:
   $$ \text{Total Amount Spent} = \text{Total Before Tip} + \text{Tip} = \$90 + \$18 ="

How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?","To solve this problem step by step, let's denote the total capacity of the water tank as \( T \) gallons. According to the information given:

1. The tank is 1/3 full, which means it has \( \frac{1}{3}T \) gallons of water already.
2. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added.

Since 16 gallons are added to the current 1/3 of the tank, we can find out how much the tank can hold in full by adding the 16 gallons to the current amount and multiplying by 3 (since 1/3 becomes 3/3 when you add the missing 2/3).

So, the calculation is:

\[ \text{Full capacity} = \left( \frac{1}{3}T + 16 \right) \times 3 \]

Let's do the math:

\[ T = \left( \frac{1}{3} \times 16 + 16 \right) \times 3 \]
\[ T = \left( \frac{16}{3} + 16 \right) \times 3 \]
\[ T = \left( \frac{"

1. First, we find out how many apples Ben has since he has 8 more than Phillip. Given that Phillip has 40 apples:
   Ben's apples = Phillip's apples + 8
   Ben's apples = 40 + 8
   Ben's apples = 48

2. Now, we know that Tom has three eighths of the number of apples Ben has:
   Tom's apples = (3/8) * Ben's apples
   Tom's apples = (3/8) * 48
   Tom's apples = 18

So, Tom has 18 apples."

John has 8 more pandas than he does lions.  John has 1/3 as many dogs as he does pandas.  How many total animals does John have?,"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. John has 15 snakes.
2. He has twice as many monkeys as snakes, so the number of monkeys is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \).
3. He has 5 fewer lions than monkeys, so the number of lions is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).
4. John has 8 more pandas than lions, so the number of pandas is \( 25 + 8 = 33 \).
5. John has 1/3 as many dogs as pandas, so the number of dogs is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 33 = 11 \).

Now, to find the total number of animals, we add up all the species:

\( \text{Snakes} + \text{Monkeys} + \text{Lions} + \text{Pandas} + \text{Dogs} \)

\( = 15 + 30 + 25 + 33 + 11 \)

train-4,19.180,237,12.36,6.027,66,Solve step by step: A portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes or a tablet in 53 minutes. Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway. How many minutes did it take?,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Ana spent charging both her tablet and her smartphone. We know that:

1. The tablet takes 53 minutes to charge fully.
2. The smartphone takes 26 minutes to charge halfway (since it's only half-charged).

First, let's find out how long it takes to charge the smartphone fully, which is half of 26 minutes:

\[ \text{Time for smartphone} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, since Ana charged her tablet fully, which takes 53 minutes, we add that to the time for the smartphone:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time for tablet} + \text{Time for smartphone} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 53 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 66 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took Ana 66 minutes to charge both her tablet and her smartphone fully."

1. Calculate the cost for the electricity based on the rate of $4 per watt for 300 watts.
2. Add the late fee of $150.

Step 1: Cost for electricity
\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Watts} \times \text{Rate per watt} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 300 \text{ watts} \times \$4/\text{watt} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$1200 \]

Step 2: Total amount
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost for electricity} + \text{Late fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$1200 + \$150 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$1350 \]

So, Darla pays a total of $1350."

The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?","To solve this problem step by step, we'll calculate the total number of puzzles and then multiply that by the time it takes to find each Waldo.

1. Total number of books: 15
2. Puzzles per book: 30
3. Time to find Waldo per puzzle: 3 minutes

First, let's find the total number of puzzles:
\( 15 \text{ books} \times 30 \text{ puzzles/book} = 450 \text{ puzzles} \)

Next, we'll calculate the total time to find all the Waldo's:
\( 450 \text{ puzzles} \times 3 \text{ minutes/puzzle} = 1350 \text{ minutes} \)

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time to hours:
\( 1350 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 22.5 \text{ hours} \)

So, it would take an average person 22.5 hours to find every Waldo in all the books."

How long is the total tape?,"To find the total length of Bart's mixtape, we need to multiply the number of songs on each side by the duration of each song and then add the two totals together.

First side:
- Number of songs: 6
- Duration per song: 4 minutes

Total duration for the first side = 6 songs * 4 minutes/song = 24 minutes

Second side:
- Number of songs: 4
- Duration per song: 4 minutes

Total duration for the second side = 4 songs * 4 minutes/song = 16 minutes

Now, we add the durations together:

Total tape length = First side duration + Second side duration
Total tape length = 24 minutes + 16 minutes
Total tape length = 40 minutes

So, the total length of the mixtape is 40 minutes."

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The old pirate has 3500 gold coins.
2. These will be evenly distributed across 5 chests, so we divide the gold coins by 5:
   \( \frac{3500}{5} = 700 \) coins per chest.

3. There are 500 silver coins that need to be distributed equally among the chests. So, we divide the silver coins by the number of chests:
   \( \frac{500}{5} = 100 \) coins per chest.

4. The number of bronze coins is twice the number of silver coins, so:
   \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \) bronze coins.

5. Now, we distribute the bronze coins equally:
   \( \frac{1000}{5} = 200 \) bronze coins per chest.

6. To find the total number of coins in each chest, we add the gold, silver, and bronze coins together:

In the second week, half as many new coronaviruses cases as the first week was recorded by the state. In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded in the state. What is the total number of recorded new coronaviruses in the state after the three weeks?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. New York recorded 5000 new coronavirus cases in the first week.
2. In the second week, they recorded half as many cases as the first week. So we calculate:
   \( \text{Second week cases} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5000 \)
3. In the third week, they recorded 2000 more cases than the second week.

First, let's find out the number of cases for the second week:
\( \text{Second week cases} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500 \)

Now, we add the cases from all three weeks to find the total:
\( \text{Total cases} = \text{First week cases} + \text{Second week cases} + \text{Third week cases} \)
\( \text{Total cases} = 5000 + 2500 + 2000 \)
