The reviewer is criticizing Beck's use of ""quick-cut editing"" and associating it with the style of a heavy metal music video, suggesting that he believes his work imitates System of a Down in an unoriginal or perhaps over-the-top way. The phrase ""under the illusion"" implies that the reviewer doesn't think Beck is successful in creating a unique or high-quality piece, and the use of ""blaring"" to describe the heavy metal adds to the criticism, suggesting that the audio is overwhelming or not well-executed.

The phrase ""the director knows how to apply textural gloss"" suggests that the director has skill in visual presentation, which could be seen as a positive aspect. However, the following part ""but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom"" indicates that the reviewer feels the director's portrayal of a serious topic (sex as war) is not handled with the depth or complexity it should be, and instead comes across as a simplistic or轻浮 (""strictly sitcom""), which is generally considered a criticism.

Therefore, the overall sentiment is negative due to the dissatisfaction with the execution of the subject matter."
