If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?","To find the total amount of money spent at the restaurant, we first need to calculate the cost of the entrees and then add the cost of the appetizer to it.

Cost of appetizer = $10
Number of entrees = 4
Cost of each entree = $20

Cost of entrees = Number of entrees * Cost of each entree
Cost of entrees = 4 * $20
Cost of entrees = $80

Total cost before tip = Cost of appetizer + Cost of entrees
Total cost before tip = $10 + $80
Total cost before tip = $90

Now, we need to calculate the tip amount. Tip is 20% of the total cost before tip.

Tip amount = Total cost before tip * Tip percentage
Tip amount = $90 * 0.2
Tip amount = $18

Finally, we add the tip amount to the total cost before tip to get the final amount spent at the restaurant.

Total amount spent = Total cost before tip + Tip amount
Total amount spent = $90 + $18
Total amount spent = $108"

How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?","Let's denote the total capacity of the water tank as X (in gallons). We are given two pieces of information:

1. The tank is 1/3 full, which means there are currently 1/3 * X gallons of water in the tank.
2. Sixteen gallons of water are added to the tank, making the total amount of water in the tank X / 3 + 16 gallons.

We want to find the total capacity X of the water tank. To do this, we can set up an equation and solve for X:

X / 3 + 16 = X

To solve for X, we first need to isolate X on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 16 from both sides and then multiplying both sides by 3:

X - 16 = 3X / 3
X - 16 = X
X - X = 16 / 3
0 = 16 / 3

This equation does not have a solution, which means our initial assumption that the tank was 1/3 full when it actually held 1/3 * X"

1. We know that Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip, so Ben has a total of: Apples for Ben = Apples for Phillip + 8
2. We're also told that Tom has three eighths as many apples as Ben. So, Apples for Tom = (3/8) * Apples for Ben
3. We're given the number of apples Phillip has: Apples for Phillip = 40

Now we can find out how many apples Ben has:
Apples for Ben = Apples for Phillip + 8 = 40 + 8 = 48

Next, we can find out how many apples Tom has:
Apples for Tom = (3/8) * Apples for Ben = (3/8) * 48 = 13.5 * 6 = 40.5 * (1/2) = 20.25 * 2 = 40.5 * 2 = 81

However, Tom cannot have a fractional number of apples, so there seems to"

John has 8 more pandas than he does lions.  John has 1/3 as many dogs as he does pandas.  How many total animals does John have?,"Let's denote the number of monkeys John has as x. Since he has twice as many monkeys as snakes, the number of snakes is x/2.

He has 5 fewer lions than monkeys, so the number of lions is x - 5.

He has 8 more pandas than lions, so the number of pandas is x - 5 + 8 = x + 3.

He has 1/3 as many dogs as pandas, so the number of dogs is (x + 3) * 1/3.

Now we can find the total number of animals:

Total animals = Snakes + Monkeys + Lions + Pandas + Dogs

Total animals = x + x/2 + (x - 5) + (x + 3) + (x/3)

Total animals = x + x/2 + x - 5 + x + 3 + x/3

Total animals = 3x + 3/2 - 2

Since we don't have a specific value for x, we cannot find the exact number of total animals. We only have a"

Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway. How many minutes did it take?,"Let's denote the charging time for the smartphone as S and the charging time for the tablet as T. We know that:

1. The portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in S minutes.
2. The portable battery charger can fully charge a tablet in T minutes.

From the problem statement, we have:

S = 26 minutes (for a smartphone)
T = 53 minutes (for a tablet)

Ana charged her tablet fully, which took T minutes. She also charged her phone halfway. Since charging a phone halfway would take less time than charging it fully, we can assume that it took half the time to charge her phone halfway:

Half charging time for the smartphone (S/2) minutes

To find the total charging time, we add the charging time for the tablet and the charging time for the phone:

Total charging time = T (for the tablet) + S/2 (for the phone)

Substitute the given values:

Total charging time = 53 minutes + 26 minutes / 2

Total charging time = 53 minutes + 13 minutes

How much does she pay in total?","To find the total amount Darla pays for the electricity, we first need to calculate the cost of the electricity itself, and then add the late fee.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the electricity:
Cost of electricity = Price per watt * Number of watts
Cost of electricity = $4/watt * 300 watts
Cost of electricity = $1200

Step 2: Add the late fee:
Total amount = Cost of electricity + Late fee
Total amount = $1200 + $150
Total amount = $1350

So, Darla pays a total of $1350 for the electricity and the late fee."

The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?","To find the total time it takes to find Waldo in all the puzzles across all the books, we first need to calculate the time it takes to find Waldo in one puzzle, then multiply that by the number of puzzles in one book, and finally multiply that by the number of books.

Time to find Waldo in one puzzle = 3 minutes
Number of puzzles in one book = 30
Number of books = 15

Time to find Waldo in one book = Time to find Waldo in one puzzle * Number of puzzles in one book
= 3 minutes * 30
= 90 minutes

Total time to find Waldo in all books = Time to find Waldo in one book * Number of books
= 90 minutes * 15
= 1350 minutes

To make this time more understandable, let's convert it to hours:

1350 minutes = 1350 / 60 = 22.5 hours

So, it would take approximately 22.5 hours to find Waldo in every puzzle across all the published ""Where's Waldo?"" books"

How long is the total tape?,"To find the total length of the mixtape, we first need to find the length of each side, and then add them together.

The first side has 6 songs, and each song is 4 minutes long. So, the length of the first side is:

Length of first side = Number of songs * Length of each song
Length of first side = 6 songs * 4 minutes/song
Length of first side = 24 minutes

The second side has 4 songs, and each song is also 4 minutes long. So, the length of the second side is:

Length of second side = Number of songs * Length of each song
Length of second side = 4 songs * 4 minutes/song
Length of second side = 16 minutes

Now, we can find the total length of the mixtape by adding the lengths of both sides:

Total length = Length of first side + Length of second side
Total length = 24 minutes + 16 minutes
Total length = 40 minutes

So, the total length of Bart's mixtape is 40 minutes."

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?","Let's break down the problem into parts:

1. The pirate wants to distribute 3500 gold coins equally across 5 chests. To find out how many gold coins each chest will contain, we divide the total number of gold coins by the number of chests:
Gold coins per chest = Total gold coins / Number of chests
Gold coins per chest = 3500 / 5
Gold coins per chest = 700

2. The pirate also wants to put 500 silver coins in each chest. So, the total number of silver coins in all chests is:
Total silver coins = Number of chests * Silver coins per chest
Total silver coins = 5 * 500
Total silver coins = 2500

3. The pirate will put twice as many bronze coins as silver coins in each chest. So, the number of bronze coins in one chest is:
Bronze coins per chest = 2 * Silver coins per chest
Bronze coins per chest = 2 * 500
Bronze coins per chest = 1000

1. New York recorded 5000 new coronavirus cases in the first week.
2. In the second week, there were half as many new cases as the first week, so there were 5000 * 0.5 = <<5000*0.5=2500>>2500 new cases.
3. In the third week, there were 2000 more cases than in the second week, so there were 2500 + 2000 = <<2500+2000=4500>>4500 new cases.
4. To find the total number of new cases recorded in the state after the three weeks, add the number of cases from each week: 5000 + 2500 + 4500 = <<5000+2500+4500=11500>>11,500.
