train-0,90.078,223,2.48,7.485,108,"Solve step by step: Stefan goes to a restaurant to eat dinner with his family. They order an appetizer that costs $10 and 4 entrees that are $20 each. If they tip 20% of the total for the waiter, what is the total amount of money that they spend at the restaurant?","First, let's calculate the cost of the entrees:
Cost of entrees = Number of entrees * Cost per entree
Cost of entrees = 4 * $20
Cost of entrees = $80

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the meal before the tip:
Total cost before tip = Cost of appetizer + Cost of entrees
Total cost before tip = $10 + $80
Total cost before tip = $90

Now, let's calculate the tip amount:
Tip amount = Total cost before tip * Tip percentage
Tip amount = $90 * 0.2
Tip amount = $18

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money they spend at the restaurant:
Total amount spent = Total cost before tip + Tip amount
Total amount spent = $90 + $18
Total amount spent = $108

So, Stefan and his family spend a total of $108 at the restaurant."

How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?","First, let's determine how many gallons of water the tank holds when it's 1/3 full. Since the tank is 1/3 full and 1/3 of the tank's capacity is 16 gallons, we can find the total capacity by multiplying the number of gallons that make the tank 1/3 full by 3:

Capacity = Gallons when 1/3 full * 3

Capacity = 16 gallons * 3

Capacity = 48 gallons

So, the tank holds 48 gallons of water when full."
train-2,103.359,256,2.48,7.461,18,"Solve step by step: Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip does. Tom has three eighths as many apples at Ben has. If Phillip has 40 apples, how many apples does Tom have?","First, we need to find out how many apples Ben has. Since Ben has 8 apples more than Phillip, we can find Ben's number by adding 8 to Phillip's number:

Ben's apples = Phillip's apples + 8
= 40 + 8
= 48 apples

Now, we know that Tom has three eighths as many apples as Ben. To find Tom's number, we can set up a proportion:

Tom's apples / Ben's apples = 3/8

Cross-multiplying, we get:

Tom's apples * 8 = 3 * Ben's apples

Substituting Ben's apples with 48, we get:

Tom's apples * 8 = 3 * 48

Solving for Tom's apples, we get:

Tom's apples = 3 * 48 / 8
= 144 / 2
= 72 apples

So, Tom has 72 apples."

John has 8 more pandas than he does lions.  John has 1/3 as many dogs as he does pandas.  How many total animals does John have?,"First, we need to find out how many monkeys John has. We know he has twice as many monkeys as snakes, so:

Monkeys = 2 * Snakes

We know John has 15 snakes, so:

Monkeys = 2 * 15 = 30

Next, we know he has 5 fewer lions than monkeys, so:

Lions = Monkeys - 5

Lions = 30 - 5 = 25

We also know he has 8 more pandas than lions, so:

Pandas = Lions + 8

Pandas = 25 + 8 = 33

Finally, we know he has 1/3 as many dogs as pandas, so:

Dogs = Pandas / 3

Dogs = 33 / 3 = 11

So, John has a total of:

Total animals = Snakes + Monkeys + Lions + Pandas + Dogs

Total animals = 15 + 30 + 25 + 33 +"
train-4,96.965,242,2.50,7.464,66,Solve step by step: A portable battery charger can fully charge a smartphone in 26 minutes or a tablet in 53 minutes. Ana charged her tablet fully and her phone halfway. How many minutes did it take?,"To find the total charging time, we need to determine how long it takes to charge each device fully and then calculate the time Ana spent charging each one based on her description.

1. Charging time for a smartphone: 26 minutes
2. Charging time for a tablet: 53 minutes

Since Ana charged her tablet fully, we know that it took 53 minutes to charge it. She also charged her phone halfway, which means it took less time than a full charge. Since the charging rate is the same for both devices, we can find the time it took to charge her phone halfway by finding half of the charging time for a full charge:

Half charging time for a smartphone = 26 minutes / 2 = 13 minutes

Now we can calculate the total charging time:

Total charging time = Charging time for tablet + Charging time for phone
Total charging time = 53 minutes + 13 minutes
Total charging time = 66 minutes

So it took Ana 66 minutes to charge her tablet fully and her phone halfway."

Cost of electricity = Price per watt * Number of watts
Cost of electricity = $4/watt * 300 watts
Cost of electricity = $1200

Next, we add the late fee to the cost of the electricity:

Total cost = Cost of electricity + Late fee
Total cost = $1200 + $150
Total cost = $1350

So, Darla pays a total of $1350 for the electricity and the late fee."
train-6,104.573,258,2.47,7.485,1350,"Solve step by step: There have been 15 ""Where's Waldo?"" books published. Each book has 30 puzzles to find Waldo. The average person takes 3 minutes to find Waldo in a puzzle. How long would it take to find every Waldo?","First, let's find out how many Waldo's there are in total across all the puzzles in all the books:

Total number of Waldo's = Number of books * Number of puzzles per book * Number of Waldo's per puzzle

Total number of Waldo's = 15 books * 30 puzzles/book * 1 Waldo/puzzle

Total number of Waldo's = 15 * 30 * 1 = 450 Waldo's

Next, let's calculate the total time it would take to find every Waldo:

Total time = Total number of Waldo's * Time per Waldo

Total time = 450 Waldo's * 3 minutes/Waldo

Total time = 450 minutes

However, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it's easier to convert this time to hours:

Total time = 450 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 7.5 hours

So, it would take 7.5 hours to find every Waldo in all the puzz"

First, let's calculate the length of the first side, which has 6 songs:

Length of first side = Number of songs * Length of each song
                               = 6 * 4 minutes
                               = 24 minutes

Next, let's calculate the length of the second side, which has 4 songs:

Length of second side = Number of songs * Length of each song
                                 = 4 * 4 minutes
                                 = 16 minutes

Now, let's find the total length of the mixtape by adding the lengths of both sides:

Total length = Length of first side + Length of second side
                    = 24 minutes + 16 minutes
                    = 40 minutes

So, the total length of Bart's mixtape is 40 minutes."

Additionally, he will put a total of 500 silver coins and twice as many bronze coins as silver, all distributed equally across the chests. How many coins in total will be in each chest?","First, let's find out how many gold coins, silver coins, and bronze coins will be in each chest.

1. Gold coins: The pirate wants to divide his 3500 gold coins equally among 5 chests. So, the number of gold coins in each chest is:
Gold coins per chest = Total gold coins / Number of chests
Gold coins per chest = 3500 / 5
Gold coins per chest = 700

2. Silver coins: The pirate wants to put 500 silver coins in total across all chests. Since there are 5 chests, the number of silver coins in each chest is:
Silver coins per chest = Total silver coins / Number of chests
Silver coins per chest = 500 / 5
Silver coins per chest = 100

3. Bronze coins: The pirate wants twice as many bronze coins as silver coins. Since there are 100 silver coins in each chest, the number of bronze coins in each chest is:

In the second week, half as many new coronaviruses cases as the first week was recorded by the state. In the third week, 2000 more cases were recorded in the state. What is the total number of recorded new coronaviruses in the state after the three weeks?","To find the total number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the state after three weeks, we need to find the number of cases in each week and then add them together.

1. In the first week, New York recorded 5000 new coronavirus cases.
2. In the second week, half as many cases as the first week were recorded, so there were 5000 * 0.5 = <<5000*0.5=2500>>2500 new cases.
3. In the third week, there were 2000 more cases than in the second week, so there were 2500 + 2000 = <<2500+2000=4500>>4500 new cases.

Therefore, the total number of recorded new coronavirus cases in the state after the three weeks is 5000 + 2500 + 4500 = <<5000+2500+4500=11500>>11,500."
