validation-2,34.853,258,7.40,13.595,New Zealand's Ross Taylor struck the highest Test score by a visiting batsman in Australia as the runs continued to flow in the second Test.,"Summarize in one sentence:
Taylor, 31, the first Kiwi double centurion against Australia, reached 290 before he was the last man to fall.
His score surpassed that of England's Tip Foster, who scored 287 against Australia in Sydney in 1903.
New Zealand made 624, their first 600 against Australia, but the hosts added 258-2 to lead by 193 with one day left.
Resuming on 235 in Perth, Taylor made the third-highest score by a New Zealand batsman. Brendon McCullum got a triple century against India in Wellington last year.
Taylor batted for nine and a half hours, facing 374 balls and hitting 43 boundaries before he was caught at deep square-leg by substitute fielder Jonny Wells.
That denied him becoming only the second batsman to score a triple century against Australia, after England's Len Hutton, who made 364 at The Oval in 1938.
It was New Zealand's fifth-highest Test team total, the record being set as recently as last year with 690 against Pakistan in Sharjah.
Having begun day four on 510-6 at the Waca, New Zealand were soon reduced to 587-9 before last man Trent Boult helped Taylor guide them past 600 and a first-innings lead of 65.
Australia lost Joe Burns for a duck in the third over but Steve Smith hit his fourth hundred as captain in only his fifth Test in charge. He shared an unbroken partnership of 212 in 55 overs with Adam Voges (101) who became the sixth centurion of the match.
Taylor celebrated both his century and double century on day three by sticking his tongue out in a message to his daughter.
He added he was ""undercooked"" going into the first Test, which New Zealand lost, after he was sidelined for six weeks by an injury to his testicles sustained in the nets in Zimbabwe in August.
""I felt I just needed to get back in the groove,"" Taylor said.
""You can either graft it out or go out and play your shots and the latter probably comes more natural to me.
""It's surprising what happens when you hit a couple off the middle, the feet start moving and the confidence comes flooding back.""
Some observers highlighted the fact that Taylor was not congratulated by the Australian players at the end of his innings.
Australia opening batsman David Warner took to Twitter to explain that as Taylor was the last player to be dismissed, the home batsmen had to leave the field to prepare for their second innings.","""Just to clarify, we didn't get a chance to congratulate Taylor on his double ton as we had to leave the field,"" Warner wrote.
""We all respect what he did and it was a great innings. We'll be looking to bat well tomorrow and try and win the game.""
Taylor's double century was the first by a New Zealand batsman against Australia and the third highest individual score in Test history.
He faced 374 balls and hit 43 boundaries, surpassing the previous New Zealand record of 299 by Martin Crowe against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 1991.
Taylor's innings came in the context of a New Zealand team that has struggled to score runs against Australia in recent times.
Their previous highest total against Australia was 455 in Wellington in 2014, and they had not scored more than 300 in their last five Tests against the Australians.
Taylor's innings was also significant because it came in the context of a New Zealand team that has been struggling to find form in the ongoing series.

The human body is teeming with thousands of species of microbes that affect health.
A study showed that transplanting gut bacteria from obese people into mice led to the animals gaining weight, while bacteria from lean people kept them slim.
The findings were published in Science.
Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, Missouri, took gut bacteria from pairs of twins - one obese, one thin.
The bacteria were then put into mice which had grown up in completely sterile environments and had no gut bacteria of their own.
Mice with the obese twin's bacteria became heavier and put on more fat than mice given bacteria from a lean twin - and it was not down to the amount of food being eaten.
There were differences in the number and types of bacteria species from the lean and obese twin.
Overall it seemed those from a lean twin were better at breaking down fibre into short-chain fatty acids. It meant the body was taking up more energy from the gut, but the chemicals were preventing fatty tissue from building up and increased the amount of energy being burned.
One of the researchers, Prof Jeffrey Gordon, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: ""We don't dine alone, we dine with trillions of friends - we have to consider the microbes which live in our gut.""
However, the diet was also important for creating the right conditions for the lean twin's bacteria to flourish. A bacterial obesity therapy seems unlikely to work alongside a a diet of greasy burgers.
Think you're all human? You may need to think again.
For every cell that makes up the human body there are 10 bacteria living on and in it.
This diversity of life is called the microbiome and it is no surprise that it affects our health.
There have even been some patients who have had faecal transplants in an attempt to change the nature of their gut bacteria.
Patients with C. difficile infections have an imbalance of bacteria which antibiotics sometimes fail to treat.
Some medical reports suggest that samples taken from a healthy gut and piped into the patient can cure the infection.
How big an impact adjusting the microbiome could have on our lives is still debated, but it is an exciting field of research.
Do faecal transplants have a medical role?
First census of bugs living on us
Keeping both sets of mice in the same cage kept them both lean if they were fed a low-fat, high-fibre diet. Mice are coprophagic, meaning they eat each other's droppings, and the lean twin's bacteria were passed into the mice which started with bacteria that should have made them obese.
However, a high-fat, low-fibre diet meant the mice still piled on the pounds.
A human obesity treatment is unlikely to use transplants of thousands of species of bacteria from lean people's guts as it carries the risk of also transferring infectious diseases.
Instead a search for the exact mix of bacteria which benefit weight - and the right foods to promote their growth - is more likely.
Prof Gordon said the next steps in the field would be ""trying to figure out how general these effects are, what diet ingredients may promote their beneficial activities and to look forward to a time when food and the value of food is considered in light of the microbes that live in our gut - that foods will have to be designed from the inside out as well as from the outside in.""
Commenting on the research, Prof Julian Parkhill, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said he expected a future when manipulating bacteria was a part of obesity treatment.
""There's a lot of work to do, but this is proof of concept that bacteria in the gut can modulate obesity in adults, but it is diet-dependent,"" he said.
He added that changing bacteria was a promising field for other diseases.
He told the BBC: ""It's an exciting new area, but I think we need to be careful in promoting it as a cure-all.
""It's clear in specific areas - inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, Crohn's - the microbiome is going to be important.""","But he warned that the microbiome was complex and there were many unknowns.
""We need to be careful in how we interpret the data and how we apply it to humans,"" he said.
""We need to be careful in how we promote it to the public.""

Naweed Ali, 29, from Sparkhill, Birmingham, is on trial along with three other men from the West Midlands.

They were arrested on 26 August after a partially-constructed pipe bomb, machete and imitation gun were discovered by security services in Mr Ali's car.
Both Mr Ali, of Evelyn Road, and his co-accused Khobaib Hussain, 25, also of Evelyn Road, have previous convictions for attending a terror training camp.
See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here
The Old Bailey heard Mr Ali had been employed by the officer - described in court only as ""Vincent"" - to deliver parcels.
On his first day, Mr Ali's Seat Leon was parked at a depot in Birmingham city centre while he went to Luton to deliver a parcel, the court heard.
Cross-examining, Stephen Kamlish QC suggested the officer had planted a bag of incriminating evidence in Mr Ali's car before MI5 arrived to bug it.
Mr Kamlish, for Mr Ali, said to Vincent: ""You had until he left the car and MI5 came in, to plant a bag of incriminating items in his car. This was your only opportunity - yes or no?""
The officer said: ""That's a interesting work of fiction. I'm afraid nothing you have just said to me makes any sense to me whatsoever. So no.""
At a previous hearing, Vincent told jurors that during a search of Mr Ali's car, what appeared to be a pipe bomb and a handgun were found inside a JD Sports bag.
He told jurors he and another officer had eased the contents of the bag on to a ground sheet and carried it into a different room.
On Monday, Mr Kamlish asked the officer why he had put his hand in the bag and pulled out what he thought was a ""live bomb"" after the secret services had been told to leave the depot.
Vincent said it was a ""calculated risk"" and added: ""I'm not a bomb disposal expert but I know what a pipe bomb looks like.
""This was a fast-moving, difficult situation and difficult decisions had to be made and that difficult decision was made.""
The barrister told Vincent he had known it was not a real bomb ""because you put it there"".
Asked if he planted the device, Vincent said: ""I would never be involved in anything like that, have never, and will never.""

Prince William held talks with President Obama in the Oval Office, in advance of delivering a speech to the World Bank on wildlife crime.
During the speech, he described the illegal wildlife trade as ""one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today"".
His wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, visited a New York children's centre.
The couple arrived in New York on Sunday night, with the prince travelling to Washington alone on Monday.
At the White House, the prince joked with Mr Obama about the birth of Prince George, saying: ""The excitement of the event and everything else was just chaos.""
He added that he expects a ""busy year"" in 2015, when Catherine is due to give birth to the royal couple's second child.
President Obama said the prince's work to protect endangered wildlife was ""very important"".
It seems fair to assume that America's first family would happily have received William and his wife to the White House.
As it was, only Prince William got to sit by the presidential fireplace in the Oval Office and chat to President Obama, reminiscing about the birth of Prince George and presumably - after the media had been ushered out - discussing his campaign against the illegal trade in wildlife parts.
Catherine had stayed in New York to pursue her very deliberately separate programme.
Both the tour planners and the couple are anxious to give both of them a chance to be seen pursuing their separate objectives without either overshadowing the other.
And so Prince William was given a clear run to pay his visit to the White House and deliver his speech at the World Bank without any risk of being upstaged by Catherine's presence.
There is certainly not the envy or sense of competition that existed between Prince William's father and mother when they were fulfilling engagements.
Instead there is a realistic awareness of each other's ability to command column inches and a desire to work together to achieve the maximum impact.
Later, in his speech at the World Bank, the prince said: ""In my view, one of the most insidious forms of corruption and criminality in the world today is the illegal wildlife trade.""
He attacked those who ""loot our planet to feed mankind's ignorant craving for exotic pets, trinkets, cures and ornaments derived from the world's vanishing and irreplaceable species"".
Paying tribute to his father, the Prince of Wales, and his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, he said: ""They helped to bring about a revolution in attitudes towards our natural environment.""
Prince William founded the umbrella organisation United for Wildlife to try to preserve the planet's most endangered animals and habitats.
The prince has been the royal patron of Tusk since 2005. The charity supports projects in 17 African countries, aimed at protecting wildlife and alleviating poverty.
Before starting at St Andrews University, the prince went on a gap year, some of which was spent in Africa learning about its wildlife and game conservation.
He added: ""From them, I learned that our relation to nature and wildlife goes to the heart of our identity as human beings. From our sheer survival, to our appreciation of beauty and our connection to all other living things.
""Seen in this light, the extinction of any of the world's species of animals is a loss to all humanity.""He said wildlife crime ""goes to the heart of our security"", ""distorts economic development"" and ""fuels sources of conflict"".

The recipient, Wolfang Rangger, who lost his right leg in 2007, said: ""It feels like I have a foot again.  It's like a second lease of life.""
Prof Hubert Egger of the University of Linz, said sensors fitted to the sole of the artificial foot, stimulated nerves at the base of the stump.
He added it was the first time that a leg amputee had been fitted with a sensory-enhanced prosthesis.
Surgeons first rewired nerve endings in the patient's stump to place them close to the skin surface.
Six sensors were fitted to the base of the foot, to measure the pressure of heel, toe and foot movement.
These signals were relayed to a micro-controller which relayed them to stimulators inside the shaft where it touched the base of the stump.
These vibrated, stimulating the nerve endings under the skin, which relayed the signals to the brain.
Prof Egger said: ""The sensors tell the brain there is a foot and the wearer has the impression that it rolls off the ground when he walks.""
Wolfgang Ranger, a former teacher, who lost his leg after a blood clot caused by a stroke, has been testing the device for six months, both in the lab and at home.
He said:  ""I no longer slip on ice and I can tell whether I walk on gravel, concrete, grass or sand.  I can even feel small stones.""
The 54-year-old also runs, cycles and goes climbing.
Another major benefit was a reduction in excruciating ""phantom limb"" pain felt by Mr Rangger for years following the amputation.
Prof Egger said the brain now received real data rather than searching for information from the missing limb.
The Austrian research team unveiled their results at a press conference in Vienna.
But they have yet to publish details in a medical journal.
Last year an international team created a bionic hand which allows the amputee to feel sensations from their fingers.
Their study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Dr Alastair Ritchie, lecturer in Biomaterials and Bioengineering, University of Nottingham, said the Austrian announcement was exciting but not as groundbreaking as the work already done for the arm and hand.","He said: ""The Austrian team have done a great job but it's not the first time we've seen a sensory prosthetic foot.
""The real challenge is to make a sensory prosthetic hand that can provide the user with the same level of sensation as a real hand.
